ABOUT REV 0001 - 02 November 2005

I'm calling this release 0001 since the first was really just a quick proof-of-
concept hack.  As of this release, Mobile Processing is now a completely 
separate application from Processing- it no longer shares its preferences and 
sketch directory with its parent application, its directories and filenames have 
been appropriately renamed.  It also has a bunch of improvements and additions:

- New Preferences dialog includes Mobile tab for setting Wireless Toolkit
  directory.  No more editing preferences.txt!

- Export Applet item in File Menu will build the MIDlet and also create a
  webpage with the open source Microemulator applet for previewing it in
  a browser.  Let the code sharing begin!

- Mac OS X support for the Mpowerplayer SDK.  This is a MIDP 2.0 compliant
  toolkit for building MIDlets on the Mac.

- New PImage, PFont implementation.  Create Font in the IDE will create a
  mobile-specific font with the extension mvlw.

- New text input APIs.

- New Sound, Vibration, Net, Bluetooth, and Video libraries.
