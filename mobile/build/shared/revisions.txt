ABOUT REV 0001 - 02 November 2005

I'm calling this release 0001 since the first was really just a quick hack.  As
of this release, Mobile Processing is now a completely separate application
from Processing- it no longer shares its preferences and sketch directory with
its parent application, its directories and filenames have been appropriately
renamed.  It also has a bunch of improvements and additions:

- New Preferences dialog includes Mobile tab for setting Wireless Toolkit
  directory.  No more editing preferences.txt!

- Export Applet item in File Menu will build the MIDlet and also create a
  webpage with the open source Microemulator applet for previewing it in
  a browser.  Let the code sharing begin!

- Mac OS X support for the Mpowerplayer SDK.  This is a MIDP 2.0 compliant
  toolkit for building MIDlets on the Mac.
