This file reflects the ongoing history of revisions to the Mobile Processing
software, including its core and library APIs.

Image2 0002
===========

- Minor change to get() to handle out-of-bounds coordinate.

Bluetooth 0005
==============

- Changed service discovery to look for all l2cap protocol services, which
  returns a more interesting list of things.

Core 0005
=========

- New textWrap() function performs word-wrapping and returns an array of
  String objects representing individual lines. Also, text() can now
  word-wrap text to fit a bounding box.

- The background(), fill(), color(), and stroke() functions can now all take
  values with alpha.

- A length() function returns the number of elements in an array. Essentially
  the same as array.length, but this is needed to get around a bug in the Jikes
  compiler that complains when using that syntax.

Bluetooth 0004
==============

- Refactored a bit- made name, description and provider public fields in
  Service rather than functions, added a new find() function that handles
  most of the discovery business for you.

Bluetooth 0003
==============

- Fixed a bug with server connection handling introduced in 0002.

Image2 0001
===========

- New! The PImage2 class provides much of the functionality of the original
  Processing PImage class, including access to the pixel buffer, alpha 
  blending support, etc.

Core 0004
=========

- Internals changed to support new Image2 library.

ABOUT REV 0005 - 18 May 2006

An update to fix some bugs with the auto-update feature!  Also fixes a bug
with the Sketch menu having incorrect Run/Present applet items.  They have
been replaced with "Build and Run" (default action on play) and "Run" items.
You can also hold SHIFT while clicking on the play button to "Run" without
re-building.  This is useful when you want to have more than one instance
of the emulator running the same sketch (for testing bluetooth or
messaging, for example).  This release also includes the following fixes
to the core and library apis.

Bluetooth 0002
==============

- Changed discover process to run in background, fetch friendly names 
  automatically after discover inquiry is complete.

Core 0003
=========

- Changed loadStrings() and loadBytes() to return 0 length arrays instead of
  throwing an exception if file/data not found.

Core 0002
=========

- Callbacks for suspend(), resume(), and destroy() events.

- Fixed hour() function to return 24 hour value instead of 12 hour 
  morning/evening value.

ABOUT REV 0004 - 10 May 2006

First release in a long while.  This release brings the development environment
up to date with the recent 114 build of Processing.  Plus, it adds to the 
auto-update mechanism so that the core APIs and libraries can be updated
separately- hopefully this will allow faster bug fixes and new features and
libraries to be released.

ABOUT REV 0003 - 29 January 2006

Primarily a bug fix release:

- Fixed applet export, added links into applet web page template to include
  download links for the obfuscated build.

- Fixed preverify issues on Mac OS X build.  Should now be generating valid
  builds for older MIDP 1.0 phones.

- Fixed cldc version preverify issues- should now properly report invalid
  language constructs (i.e. float) when building for CLDC 1.0

- Fixed problem with Proguard obfuscation when building with libraries.

- Changed Mac OS X build folder to not have a space in its name.

ABOUT REV 0002 - 20 January 2006 

- Support for touchscreen devices. pointerPressed, pointerX, pointerY,
  pointerPressed(), pointerDragged(), pointerReleased() added.

- Handset library renamed to Phone library.  The new Phone library has support
  for launching the phone browser, making a phone call, and fullscreen drawing.

- Net Client library is now part of the standard core features as PClient.

- Xml library added.

- Proguard obfuscation/pruning/shrinking added on export.

ABOUT REV 0001 - 02 November 2005

I'm calling this release 0001 since the first was really just a quick proof-of-
concept hack.  As of this release, Mobile Processing is now a completely 
separate application from Processing- it no longer shares its preferences and 
sketch directory with its parent application, its directories and filenames have 
been appropriately renamed.  It also has a bunch of improvements and additions:

- New Preferences dialog includes Mobile tab for setting Wireless Toolkit
  directory.  No more editing preferences.txt!

- Export Applet item in File Menu will build the MIDlet and also create a
  webpage with the open source Microemulator applet for previewing it in
  a browser.  Let the code sharing begin!

- Mac OS X support for the Mpowerplayer SDK.  This is a MIDP 2.0 compliant
  toolkit for building MIDlets on the Mac.

- New PImage, PFont implementation.  Create Font in the IDE will create a
  mobile-specific font with the extension mvlw.

- New text input APIs.

- New Sound, Vibration, Net, Bluetooth, and Video libraries.
