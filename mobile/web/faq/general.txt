handsets
Will sketches from Mobile Processing run on my handset?
Sketches created using Mobile Processing will run on Java Powered handsets, also known as Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) handsets. Mobile Processing sketches are mobile applications, called MIDlets, that are currently compatible with the CLDC 1.0, MIDP 1.0 release of the J2ME platform.
