This is broken! I found a bug! Nothing is happening!
</h5>
<p>Most answers can be found on the <a href="/reference/troubleshooting/">troubleshooting</A> page, or in the reference for the function or library that you're using. Please read them!</p>

<h5 id="download"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      How can I obtain Processing and how much does it cost?</h5>
   
    <p>The software is free to download and use.
If you are interested in testing the BETA version of the software, 
visit the <a href="/download/">download</a> 
page and follow the instructions.</p>

    <p>We think it's important to have Processing freely available, rather
than selling it for a million dollars under some godawful yearly
contract update scheme. To that end, we encourage people to spread
the word and refer them to <a href="http://processing.org">processing.org</a>.</p>


<h5 id="start"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      How do I get started?</h5>
   
     <p>Double click the 'Processing' application (on Linux, type <TT>./processing</TT>). Select something from File &rarr; Examples. Hit the Run button
(which looks like the play button on a VCR or tape deck). 
Lather, rinse, repeat as necessary.</p>

    <p><A HREF="http://www.flight404.com/">Robert Hodgin</A> also has a helpful explanation of <A HREF="http://www.flight404.com/blog/?p=100">getting started</A> on his site.</p>

    <p>More information on using Processing itself is can be found in the 
<a href="/reference/environment/">environment</a>
section of the reference.</p>

    <p>Again, if you're having trouble getting Processing to start, check the
<a href="/reference/troubleshooting/index.html#nostart">troubleshooting</a> 
section of the reference for possible solutions.</p>

<h5 id="learn"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      How do I learn to use Processing?</h5>
 
    <p>To learn the Processing language, we recommend you try a few of the
built-in examples, and check out the <a href="">reference</a>. </p>

    <p>When using the examples (or trying someone else's code), 
if you run across a function that you're not familiar with, 
highlight the word, right-click (ctrl-click on the mac), 
and select "Find in Reference" to open the reference page
for that keyword. This can be helpful for understanding how
programs work.</p>

<p>If you're stuck or want to talk about your work, head over to the <A HREF="/discourse/">discourse</A> section of the site to find
open minds and helpful peers.</p>

<p>Once you've graduated beyond the examples and devoured the <A HREF="/reference/index_ext.html">"complete"</A> reference, also check out the <A HREF="/hacks/">Processing Hacks</A> site: it's not quite reference, not quite examples, and not as developed as a library. These mutants are known as hacks, and there's lots of good stuff to be found.</p>


<h5 id="revisions"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
I downloaded a new version and my code no longer works!
</h5>
<p>Read the <A HREF="/download/revisions.txt">revisions.txt</A> file that's included with the download (or use that link to read the online version). Things change between releases, and something may have broken your code, or your code may be using something unsupported, which no longer behaves.</p>


<h5 id="changes"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
I'm trying to run some code I found on the web, and it doesn't work
</h5>
<p>The code may be using syntax from an older release of Processing. Information about updating your code can be found on the <A HREF="/reference/changes.html">changes between releases</A> page.
<p>Also check <A HREF="/download/revisions.txt">revisions.txt</A> to make sure it's not something that's covered there.</p>


<h5 id="platforms"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      On what platforms can I run Processing?</h5>
	  
    <p>We release versions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. 
We test extensively on Mac and Windows platforms, but not much on Linux.</p>

    <p>More detailed information for the specific platforms can be found 
in the <a href="/reference/environment/platforms.html">Platforms</a> section,
which also includes information about running the Processing
Development Environment on <a href="/reference/environment/platforms.html#other">other
platforms</a>.</p>

<h5 id="opensource"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Is Processing Open Source? How 'bout some code?</h5>

    <p>The Processing development environment is released as open source
under the GPL. The export libraries (also known as 'core') are
released under an LGPL license, which means they can be used 
as a library and included in your project without you having to open up 
your code (though we encourage people to share anyway). But if
you make changes to core, you have to submit back to us. 
More information about the GNU Public License can be found at <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.</p>

    <p>The source code is stored on our <a
href="http://dev.processing.org/">developer site</a>, and more
information about its use can be found over there.</p>

    <p>We need help! Having shared all the code and made it available for
free, doesn't it just make you want to pitch in and help? We have too much work
to do and can't keep up with things. We love to see bug fixes, new
libraries, etc. If you're interested, contact us via the <a
href="/discourse/">discourse</a> section of the
site.</p>

    <p>The source code for the libraries is also included with the Processing
software itself, should you want to modify them for your own use. If you
want to modify the library for your own use, you can include the .java file 
as part of your sketch. Just be sure to remove the "package processing.xx;" 
line at the beginning. The Processing environment does not allow packages.

    <p>Processing also relies on (and is indebted to) other open projects, namely:</p>
    
<ul>

    <li>the <a href="http://syntax.jedit.org">jEdit Syntax</a> package, which is public domain</li>

    <li>the ECJ Compiler from the <A HREF="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse project</a>, which uses the Eclipse license.</li>

    <li>the <A HREF="https://jna.dev.java.net/">Java Native Access (JNA)</A> project, released under the LGPL. 

    <li>as of release 0149, we use a slightly modified version of <a href="http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/">launch4j</a> to create processing.exe on Windows.

    <li>the <a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/">quaqua</a> library, which makes Java applications look more like Mac applications when running on OS X.

    <li>...perhaps others, let us know if we're missing something.</li>
</ul>

The following are no longer in use, but we still owe them because they helped us along in earlier releases:

<ul>
    <li>the older <a href="http://www.savarese.org/oro/">ORO Matcher</a>, 
distributed under a BSD-style license as part of the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta</a> project</li>

    <li>the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jikes/">Jikes</a>
compiler, which is covered by the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ipl.html">IBM Public License</a>.</li>

    <li>com.ice.jni.registry from the <a href="http://www.gjt.org/">Giant
Java Tree</a> (GPL license) </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="attribution"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Do I have to cite Processing? Do I have to share my code? 
Can I distribute my sketches?</h5>

    <p>We like it when people include a "Built with Processing" note with a
link back to the site, since it helps create interest and brings in
more people to the project. We don't/can't/shouldn't require it, but
it makes us happy because the project is free and this is one way you
can help give back to us.</p>

    <p>You can also remove the source code from web pages that you export,
but in the spirit of the Processing project overall, we include it by
default so as to encourage sharing and learning from one another.</p>

    <p>You can distribute your sketches all you want, and commercial projects  
are just fine too, however we place no warranty on the software (see the 
download page for the license shenanigans). </p>

<h5 id="versions"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      What's with the version numbers?</h5>
	  
    <p>Processing is not yet 1.0 software.. It's buggy and may kill people.* 
That's part of why we used to make everyone sign up to download, 
so that we know that you care enough to bother and have more of an 
inkling of what you're getting into.</p>

    <p>At least until the final 1.0 version, we'll be using four digit
numbers for the release. Revision 0085 was the first "beta" release, 
which means that all the features are in, but not all the bugs
are out. There remain several known issues with the beta release 
that will need to be sorted out before we're comfortable calling 
a release an actual final 1.0.</p>

    <p>The numbered releases aren't always heavily tested, so don't be surprised 
if/when something breaks. Check the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bugs</a> 
section of the site and report the problem if it's new, and in the meantime, 
you can go back to the previous numbered release until there's a fix. </p>

<p>* <EM>Processing is not yet known to be responsible 
for any </EM>confirmed<EM> deaths.</EM></p>

<h5 id="naming"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Why is it called &ldquo;Processing&rdquo;?</h5>
	     
    <p>At their core, computers are processing machines. They modify, move, and 
combine symbols at a low level to construct higher level representations. 
Our software allows people to control these actions and representations 
through writing their own programs. The project also focuses on
the &ldquo;process&rdquo; of creation rather than end results. The design of the software supports 
and encourages sketching and the website presents fragments of projects 
and exposes the concepts behind finished software. </p>

    <p>&ldquo;Proce55ing&rdquo; is the spelling we originally used for the URL 
of the web site, because "Processing" was already taken. Even 
though it's a combination of numbers and letters, it was always
pronounced &ldquo;processing.&rdquo; Since then, 
we saved our pennies, had a can drive, and used the funds to 
acquire the processing.org domain name. 
As a result we are no longer using the name &ldquo;Proce55ing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When we see it with the 55's it annoys us and we want to 
punch people in the face. Or punch ourselves in the face for using it 
in the first place. Actually, we try not to be that emotional about it
but we're trying to avoid the previous naming. However, to
make it more confusing, we sometimes still use &ldquo;p5&rdquo;
(but not p55!) as a shortened version of the name. </p>

<h5 id="sketchbook"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      What is the sketchbook? What do you mean by sketches?</h5>
    
    <p>We think most &ldquo;integrated development environments&rdquo; 
(Microsoft Visual Studio, Codewarrior, Eclipse, etc.) tend to be
overkill for the type of audience we're targeting with Processing. For
this reason, we've introduced the 'sketchbook' which is a more lightweight 
way to organize projects. As trained designers, we'd like the process 
of coding to be a lot more like sketching. The sketchbook setup, and
the idea of just sitting down and writing code (without having
to write two pages to set up a graphics context, thread, etc) is
a small step towards that goal. </p>

    <p>The idea of just writing a short piece of code that runs very easily
(via a little run button) is a direct descendant of John Maeda's work
in <a href="http://dbn.media.mit.edu/">Design By Numbers</a>, and 
our experiences maintaining it. (Yes, other languages and environments 
have done this first, but in our case, the concept is drawn from DBN).</p>

<h5 id="whyjava"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Why Java? Or why such a Java-esque programming language?</h5>
    
    <p>We didn't set out to make the ultimate language for visual
programming, we set out to make something that was:</p>

    <ol>
        <li> a sketchbook for our own work, simplifying the majority 
    of tasks that we undertake, </li>
        <li> a teaching environment for that kind of process, and </li>
        <li> a point of transition to more complicated or difficult 
    languages like full-blown Java or C++ (a gateway drug to 
    more geekier and more difficult things)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and
simplicity of use. i.e. if we didn't care about speed, Python, Ruby
or many other scripting languages would make far more sense
(especially for the simplicity and education aspect of it). 
If we didn't care about transition to more advanced languages, 
we'd get rid of the crummy C-style (well, algol, really) syntax. 
etc etc.</p>

    <p>Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's
far more forgiving than C++ and also allows users to export sketches for
distribution via the web. </p>

    <p>Processing is not intended as the ultimate environment/language (in
fact, the language is just Java, but with a new graphics and 
utility API along with some simplifications). Fundamentally, 
Processing just assembles our experience in building things, 
and trying to simplifies the parts that we felt should be easier. </p>

<h5 id="flash"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Dude, Where's the Timeline? This Sucks&hellip; / Awesome! A Flash Killer!</h5>

    <p>We're not targeting the same audience Flash. 
If we wanted to make a Flash killer, we'd
have set out to do that and our stated purpose would have been more
specific (and we'd have more on the site about "Processing vs. Flash"
in the competitive shootout sense... right now we just have
information about how the syntax differs so that people can make the
transition).</p>

    <p>We could have saved a lot of time if we just wanted to build a better
Flash. But as two people, do you really think we can or
should bother competing with a company as large as Macromedia?
Macrodobe? Does anyone really want a "better" Flash? 
We certainly don't, so that's not an interesting goal for us.</p>

    <p>There are things that are always going to be better in Flash,
and other types of work that will always be better in Processing. But
fundamentally (and this cannot be emphasized enough), this is not an
all-or-nothing game&hellip; We're talking about tools. Do people refuse
to use pencils because pens exist? No, you just use them for different
things, and for specific reasons. If Processing works for you, then
use it. If not, don't. It's easy! It's free! You're not being forced
to do anything.</p>


<h5 id="java"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
I know Java, is this Java? How do I use it that way?
</h5>

<p>Processing code is converted to straight Java code (using the "preprocessor") when you hit the Run button. This also makes it possible to embed other Java code in your sketches, or use the core.jar file from the Processing distribution to develop your own sketches with other environments. For instance, if you want to use <A HREF="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</A>, there are instructions on the <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/">discourse</A> section of the site.</p>

<p>The main rule when using Java code: You cannot use most of the AWT or Swing (which is built on the AWT), because it will interfere with the graphics model. If you want to add scroll bars and buttons to your projects, you should make them using Processing code, or embed your Processing applet inside another Swing or AWT application (see below). Even if they appear to work, such sketches will usually break when you try to run on other operating systems or other versions of Java.</p>

<p><em>We currently only support Java 1.4 (and earlier) syntax.</em> You cannot currently use 1.5 syntax in the Processing Development Environment. This means no generics, templates, enum, varargs, foreach, <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/releases/j2se15langfeat/">and the rest</A>. If you want to use Java 1.5 (or later), take core.jar and develop your project with another Java IDE (again, see below). More about Java versions can be found on the <A HREF="/reference/environment/platforms.html#java">platforms</A> page. A couple of the syntax features in Java 1.5 are very useful (the enhanced for loop, some aspects of generics) so if you would like to use them in Processing, please give us a hand. You can start by visiting <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=598">this bug</A> which describes the obstacles to 1.5 support.</p>

<p>Since we can't really support anything and everything that you might want to do when interfacing with Java or using core.jar inside a Java environment, we have a separate <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Integrate">discussion area</A> on the discourse board for asking questions relatd to using Processing to interface with regular Java code.</p>

<p>If you want to embed Processing into another Java application, visit the developer's reference for <A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/reference/core/javadoc/processing/core/PApplet.html">PApplet</A>. A discussion of how to use Processing with Eclipse is found <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Integrate;action=display;num=1117133941">here</A>.</p>

<p>Also note that when using the Processing API or libraries outside the PDE, the headaches of the Java CLASSPATH and PATH return, and using libraries gets much nastier. These are some of the headaches that we try to hide in the Processing environment, things that separate Processing from straight Java coding. We feel that it is important to put the good stuff at the surface, and that those details don't teach students much anyway (and they annoy advanced users too).</p>


<h5 id="dbn"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
Where does this project come from? Is this DBN?
</h5>
<p>Processing is a descendant of the <A HREF="http://dbn.media.mit.edu">Design By Numbers</A> (DBN) project and other initiatives at the <A HREF="http://acg.media.mit.edu/">ACG</A>. DBN is a simplified programming language that was developed to teach the structure and interpretation of software in a visual manner. Design By Numbers was created by John Maeda and accompanied a book of the same name. While at the ACG, Ben and Casey were involved in the development and maintenance of the DBN software and courseware, and that experience provided the basis for the Processing project.</p>
<p>While working on DBN, Ben developed several experimental versions that included other programming languages (Python and Scheme) and drawing features (color, changing the window size, magnification, movie recording, and even OpenGL support), but it was clear that these did not make sense for the DBN project because they interfered with Maeda's intention of a simplified programming language and environment.</p>
<p>At the time (between 1998-2000), work at the ACG was usually developed via sketches written in Java and later moved to applications written in C++ using OpenGL. We were interested in melding the idea of "sketching" in code with the pedagogical aspect of DBN. Development of Processing began formally in the Spring of 2001 with discussions between Casey and Ben about API and feature set, and the first few versions of Processing (releases 0001, 0003, and 0005) were used in August 2001 at a <A HREF="http://dbn.media.mit.edu/workshops/musabi/">workshop</A> at Musashino Art University in Japan.</p>

      Why Is Processing Connecting to the Network?</h5>
    
    <p>After you double-click Processing, it will check the site for
updates. This is helpful so that we can keep people
aware of the frequent updates to Processing. </p>

    <p>In so doing, it also sends a random number that identifies yours as a
unique machine (but sends no personal information to us). 
This really helps us get a general idea of how many people are using the
software, which is really important for things like
writing grants so that we can keep Processing free.</p>

    <p>If the network connection causes you trouble, it can be shut off
inside the Preferences window.</p>


<h5 id="typeface"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      What is that fantastic typeface used for the page headers?</h5>
    
    <p>The typeface &ldquo;PS&rdquo; was developed specifically for Processing by 
Mike Cina of <a href="http://www.weworkforthem.com">WeWorkForThem</a>. Other 
typefaces designed by Mike are available at <a href="http://www.youworkforthem.com">YouWorkForThem</a>.</p>
