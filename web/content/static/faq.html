      When can I download Processing and how much does it cost?</h5>
   
    <p>The software is free to download.
If you are interested in testing the BETA version of the software, 
visit the <a href="http://processing.org/download/">download</a> 
page and follow the instructions.</p>

    <p>We think it's important to have Processing freely available, rather
than selling it for a million dollars under some godawful yearly
contract update scheme. To that end, we encourage people to spread
the word and refer them to the <a href="http://processing.org">processing.org</a> site.</p>

<h5 id="start"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      How do I get started?</h5>
   
     <p>Double click the 'Processing' application, and select something from
the examples menu: File &rarr; Open &rarr; Examples. Hit the 'run' button
(which looks like the play button on a vcr or tape deck).</p>

    <p>Lather, rinse, repeat as necessary.</p>
    
    <p>More information on using Processing itself is can be found in the 
<a href="http://processing.org/reference/environment/index.html">environment</a>
section of the reference.</p>

    <p>If you're having trouble getting Processing to start, check 
<a href="bugs.html#nostart">here</a> for possible solutions.</p>

<h5 id="learn"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      How do I learn to use Processing?</h5>
 
    <p>To learn the Processing language, we recommend you try a few of the examples, 
read some of the <a href="">tutorials</a> and check out the 
<a href="">reference</a>. </p>

    <p>When using the examples (or trying someone else's code), 
if you run across a function that you're not familiar with, 
highlight the word, right-click (ctrl-click on the mac), 
and select "Find in Reference" to open the reference page
for that keyword. This can be helpful for understanding how
programs work.</p>

<h5 id="platforms"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      On what platforms can I run Processing?</h5>
	  
    <p>We release versions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. 
We test extensively on Mac and Windows platforms, but not much on Linux.</p>

    <p>More detailed information for the specific platforms can be found 
in the <a href="platforms.html">Platforms</a> section of this FAQ,
which also includes information about running the Processing
Development Environment on <a href="platforms.html#other">other
platforms</a>.</p>

<h5 id="opensource"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Is Processing Open Source?</h5>

    <p>The Processing development environment is released as open source
under the GPL. The export libraries (also known as 'core') are
released under an LGPL license, which means they can be used 
as a library and included in your project without you having to open up 
your code (though we encourage people to share anyway). But if
you make changes to core, you have to submit back to us. 
More information about the GNU Public License can be found at <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.</p>

    <p>Processing also relies on other open projects, namely:</p>
    
<ul>
    <li>the older <a href="http://www.savarese.org/oro/">ORO Matcher</a>, 
distributed under a BSD-style license as part of the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/">Apache Jakarta</a> project</li>

    <li>the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jikes/">Jikes</a>
compiler, which is covered by the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-ipl.html">
IBM Public License</a>.</li>

    <li>the <a href="http://syntax.jedit.org">jEdit Syntax</a> package,
which is public domain</li>

    <li>com.ice.jni.registry from the <a href="http://www.gjt.org/">Giant
Java Tree</a> (GPL license) </li>

    <li>perhaps others but that's all I can think of right now while we're
cramming for the beta release</li>
</ul>

    <p>The source code is stored on our <a
href="http://dev.processing.org/">developer site</a>, and more
information about its use can be found over there.</p>

    <p>We need help! Having shared all the code and made it available for
free, doesn't it just make you want to pitch in? We have too much work
to do and can't keep up with things. We love to see bug fixes, new
libraries, etc. If you're interested, contact us via the <a
href="http://processing.org/discourse">discourse</a> section of the
site.</p>

<h5 id="attribution"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Do I have to cite Processing? Do I have to share my code? 
Can I distribute my sketches?</h5>

    <p>We like it when people include a "Built with Processing" note with a
link back to the site, since it helps create interest and brings in
more people to the project. We don't/can't/shouldn't require it, but
it makes us happy because the project is free and this is one way you
can help give back to us.</p>

    <p>You can also remove the source code from web pages that you export,
but in the spirit of the Processing project overall, we include it by
default so as to encourage sharing and learning from one another.</p>

    <p>You can distribute your sketches all you want, and commercial projects should 
be just fine too, however we place no warranty on the software (see the 
download page for the license shenanigans). </p>

<h5 id="versions"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      What's with the version numbers?</h5>
	  
    <p>This is not 1.0 software.. It's buggy and may kill people. That's part
of why we used to make everyone sign up to download, so that we know that you 
care enough to bother and have more of an inkling of what you're 
getting into.</p>

    <p>At least until the final 1.0 version, we'll be using four digit
numbers for the release. Revision 0085 was the first "beta" release, 
which means that all the features are in, but not all the bugs
are out. There remain several known issues with the beta release 
that will need to be sorted out before we're comfortable calling 
a release an actual final 1.0.</p>

    <p>The numbered releases aren't always heavily tested, so don't be surprised 
if/when something breaks. Check the <a href="http://processing.org/bugs/">bugs</a> 
section of the site and report the problem if it's new, and in the meantime, 
you can go back to the previous numbered release until there's a fix. </p>

<h5 id="naming"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Why is it called &ldquo;Processing&rdquo;?</h5>
	     
    <p>At their core, computers are processing machines. They modify, move, and 
combine symbols at a low level to construct higher level representations. 
Our software allows people to control these actions and representations 
through writing their own programs. The project also focuses on
the &ldquo;process&rdquo; of creation rather than end results. The design of the software supports 
and encourages sketching and the website presents fragments of projects 
and exposes the concepts behind finished software. </p>

    <p>&ldquo;Proce55ing&rdquo; is the spelling we originally used for the url. Even 
though it's a combination of numbers and letters, it was simply
pronounced &ldquo;processing.&rdquo; We saved our pennies and had a can
drive so now we've since acquired the processing.org domain name. 
As a result we are no longer using the name &ldquo;Proce55ing.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>When we see it with the 55's it annoys us and we want to punch people 
in the face. Or punch ourselves in the face for using it 
in the first place. Actually, we try not to be that emotional about it
but we're trying to kill off the previous naming. However, to
make it more confusing, we sometimes still use &ldquo;p5&rdquo;
(not p55) as a shortened version of the name. </p>

<h5 id="sketchbook"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      What is the sketchbook? What do you mean by sketches?</h5>
    
    <p>We think most &ldquo;integrated development environments&rdquo; 
(Microsoft Visual Studio, Codewarrior, Eclipse, etc.) tend to be
overkill for the type of audience we're targeting with Processing. For
this reason, we've introduced the 'sketchbook' which is a more lightweight 
way to organize projects. As trained designers, we'd like the process 
of coding to be a lot more like sketching. The sketchbook setup, and
the idea of just sitting down and writing code (without having
to write two pages to set up a graphics context, thread, etc) is
a small step towards that goal. </p>

    <p>The idea of just writing a short piece of code that runs very easily
(via a little run button) is a direct descendant of John Maeda's work
in <a href="http://dbn.media.mit.edu">Design By Numbers</a>, and 
our experiences maintaining it. (Yes, other languages and environments have done this first,
but in our case, the concept is drawn from DBN).</p>

<h5 id="whyjava"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Why Java? Or why such a Java-esque programming language?</h5>
    
    <p>We didn't set out to make the ultimate language for visual
programming, we set out to make something that was:</p>

    <ol>
        <li> a sketchbook for our own work, simplifying the majority 
    of tasks that we undertake, </li>
        <li> a teaching environment for that kind of process, and </li>
        <li> a point of transition to more complicated or difficult 
    languages like full-blown Java or C++ (a gateway drug to 
    more geekier and more difficult things)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>At the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and
simplicity of use. i.e. if we didn't care about speed, Python, Ruby
or many other scripting languages would make far more sense
(especially for the simplicity and education aspect of it). 
If we didn't care about transition to more advanced languages, 
we'd get rid of the crummy C-style (well, algol, really) syntax. 
etc etc.</p>

    <p>Java makes a nice starting point for a sketching language because it's
far more forgiving than C++ and also allows users to export sketches for
distribution via the web. </p>

    <p>Processing is not intended as the ultimate environment/language (in
fact, the language is just Java, but with a new graphics and 
utility API along with some simplifications). Fundamentally, 
Processing just assembles our experience in building things, 
and trying to simplifies the parts that we felt should be easier. </p>

<h5 id="flash"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Dude, Where's the Timeline? This Sucks&hellip; / Awesome! A Flash Killer!</h5>

    <p>We're not targeting Flash. If we wanted to make a Flash killer, we'd
have set out to do that and our stated purpose would have been more
specific (and we'd have more on the site about "Processing vs. Flash"
in the competitive shootout sense... right now we just have
information about how the syntax differs so that people can make the
transition).</p>

    <p>We could have saved a lot of time if we just wanted to build a better
Flash. And in the end, as two people, do you really think we can or
should bother competing with a company as large as Macromedia?
Macrodobe? Does anyone really want a better Flash? </p>

    <p>There are things that are always going to be better in Flash,
and other types of work that will always be better in Processing. But
fundamentally (and this cannot be emphasized enough), there is no
all-or-nothing game&hellip; We're talking about tools. Do people refuse
to use pencils because pens exist? No, you just use them for different
things, and for specific reasons. If Processing works for you, then
use it. If not, don't. It's easy! It's free! You're not being forced
to do anything.</p>

    <p>As we have heard, Flash 8 will be better at doing some of the pixel
editing/image stuff you can do in Processing, but there are still lots
of things we're covering that's not focused on moving pixels (OpenGL
acceleration, easy serial port access, video input) and other things
that are incomplete in beta but just around the corner ("Export to
Application" and more).</p>

<h5 id="update"><a href="#top"><img src="img/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Why Is Processing Connecting to the Network?</h5>
    
    <p>After you double-click Processing, it will check the site for
updates. This is helpful so that we can keep people
aware of the frequent updates to Processing. </p>

    <p>In so doing, it also sends a random number that identifies yours as a
unique machine (but sends no personal information to us). 
This really helps us get a general idea of how many people are using the
software, which is really important for things like
writing grants so that we can keep Processing free.</p>

    <p>If the network connection causes you trouble, it can be shut off
inside the Preferences window.</p>

      What is that fantastic typeface used for the page headers?</h5>
    
    <p>The typeface &ldquo;PS&rdquo; was developed specifically for Processing by 
Mike Cina of <a href="http://www.weworkforthem.com">WeWorkForThem</a>. Other 
typefaces designed by Mike are available at <a href="http://www.youworkforthem.com">YouWorkForThem</a>.</p>
