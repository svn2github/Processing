        The Processing core is very focused and minimal, but is easily extended to match additional desires and needs. If you write your own libraries for Processing, please consider sharing this code with the community. <a href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/index.html">Current libraries</a> are listed online and there's an ongoing discussion in the <a href="../discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_libraries_tools">Discourse</a>.</p>
        
        <p><img src="/img/contribute/buildtools.gif" height="25" width="205" alt="Build Tools" /><br />
        The Processing Development Environment (PDE) can be extended with tools to help with programming. For example, the Color Selector helps with finding color and converting values from one color space to another. If you write your own tools for Processing, please consider sharing this code with the community. Current Tools will be listed online soon and there's an ongoing discussion in the <a href="../discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_libraries_tools">Discourse</a>.</p>
