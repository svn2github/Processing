        Before releasing Processing 1.0, there are hundreds of bugs to fix. If you have the ability, please help expedite the launch by contributing code. The <a href="http://dev.processing.org/source/index.cgi/trunk/processing/">source is available through CVS</a> and an ongoing discussion happens in the <a href="/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_core_pde"> Discourse</a>. Check the current status through the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bugs database</a>.
