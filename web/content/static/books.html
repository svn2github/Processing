			  This book is an introduction to the ideas of computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It targets an audience of computer-savvy individuals who are interested in creating interactive and visual work through writing software but have little or no prior experience. It is the result of six years of software development and teaching experience. The ideas presented have been continually tested in the classrooms, computer labs, basements of universities, art and design schools, and arts institutions.<br />
			  <br />
			  The majority of the book is divided into tutorial units discussing specific elements of software and how they relate to the arts. These units introduce the syntax and concepts of software such as variables, functions, and object-oriented programming. They cover topics such as photography and drawing in relation to software. These units feature many short, prototypical example programs with related images and explanation. More advanced professional projects from diverse domains including 
				animation, performance, and typography are discussed in interviews with their creators. The extension sections present concise introductions to further domains of exploration including computer vision, sound, and electronics.<br />
			  <br />
			  Essays by Alexander R. Galloway, Golan Levin, R. Luke DuBois, Simon Greenwold, Francis Li, and Hernando Barragan.<br />
			  <br />
			  Interviews with Jared Tarbell, Martin Wattenberg, James Paterson, Erik van Blockland, Ed Burton, Josh On, Jeurg Lehni, Auriea Harvey and Michael Samyn, Mathew Cullen and Grady Hall, Bob Sabiston, Jennifer Steinkamp, Ruth Jarman and Joseph Gerhardt, Sue Costabile, Chris Csikszentmihalyi, Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman, and Mark Hansen.<br />

			The O'Reilly website says, &quot;How you can take advantage of data that you might otherwise never use? With the help of a powerful new programming environment [Processing], this book helps you represent data accurately on the Web and elsewhere, complete with user interaction, animation, and more. You'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets.&quot; <br />
			<br />
			Martin Wattenberg from the IBM Watson Research Center says, &quot;This wonderfully detailed guide, by one of the masters of modern data graphics, tells you everything you need to know to code your own visualizations from scratch. Perhaps most valuable are the many examples where Fry demonstrates how to refine a bare-bones concept into a beautiful, effective finished piece. Read this book, and you'll never again be dependent on someone else's view of your data.&quot;<br />

<br />
The Friends of Ed text for this book says, "The Essential Guide to Processing for Flash Developers takes a focused approach to learning Processing, targeting experienced Flash developers. The book offers a hands-on, tutorial based approach building on your familiarity with Flash and experience with ActionScript and object-oriented programming concepts. The first three chapters explain all the Processing specific programming theory you’ll need to know, with numerous code examples. The rest of the book is project based, including a 3D particle engine, forward and reverse kinematics, online gaming, information visualization, and audio/video processing. Each project is structured to allow less experienced coders to get up to speed relatively quickly, while leaving room for more experienced programmers to take the initial project concepts and run with them—building more complex applications."

The Friends of Ed website says, &quot;This book is written especially for artists, designers, and other creative professionals and students exploring code art, graphics programming, and computational aesthetics. The book provides a solid and comprehensive foundation in programming, including object-oriented principles, and introduces you to the easy-to-grasp Processing language, so no previous coding experience is necessary. The book then goes through using Processing to code lines, curves, shapes, and motion, continuing to the point where you'll have mastered Processing and can really start to unleash your creativity with realistic physics, interactivity, and 3D! In the final chapter, you'll even learn how to extend your Processing skills by working directly with the powerful Java programming language, the language Processing itself is built with.&quot; (Quote from the Friends of Ed website)<br />

Published November 2009, Schmidt Hermann Verlag. 500 pages. Hardcover. In German.<br />
<br />
This book is extraordinary. The design is clear and refined and the printing quality is fantastic. This is the design book about Processing that we've been hoping for. Unlike most other Processing books, it doesn't discuss programming basics so it's free to cut to the exciting examples. The author's write, "We... want to provide a solid foundation with this book for how this modified design process can be used. The software in the book section »Grundlegende Prinzipien« illustrate some generative techniques on the basis of the four design areas: color, shape, typo and image. This repertoire is expanded in the section »Komplexe Methoden« by combining a number of principles on the basis of six larger-scaled examples. In this section you will also find explanations of advanced techniques."

<br />
The book description reads, "Learn how to create gorgeous and expressive imagery with the Processing programming language and environment... Walk with veteran author Andrew Glassner on a journey of shared discovery as he takes actual Processing projects from inspiration to reality. You'll closely follow every step he takes and see exactly how each project evolves, including big and small mistakes he's made along the way (and how to fix them!), and the times when he changed direction. Once you see the results, you'll understand why programming is such a powerful skill for self-expression."<br />
<br />
This book has a different perspective from the others because of Glassner's deep experience in computer graphics. His bio reads, "Dr. Andrew Glassner is a writer-director, and a consultant in story structure, interactive fiction, and computer graphics. He started working in 3D computer graphics in 1978, and has carried out research at the NYIT Computer Graphics Lab, Case Western Reserve University, the IBM TJ Watson Research Lab, the Delft University of Technology, Bell Communications Research, Xerox PARC, and Microsoft Research... He is also a well-known writer, and has published numerous technical papers and books on topics ranging from 3D modeling, rendering, and animation to digital sound synthesis. His book '3D Computer Graphics: A Handbook for Artists and Designers' has taught a generation of artists through two editions and three languages. Glassner created and edited the 'Graphics Gems' series and created and wrote several chapters in the book 'An Introduction to Ray Tracing'. He wrote the two-volume text 'Principles of Digital Image Synthesis'."</td>

&quot;Through a series of simple projects, this book teaches you how to get your creations to communicate with one another by forming networks of smart devices that carry on conversations with you and your environment. Whether you need to plug some sensors in your home to the Internet or create a device that can interact wirelessly with other creations, Making Things Talk explains exactly what you need... With a little electronic know-how, a couple of inexpensive microcontroller kits and some network modules to make them communicate using Ethernet, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, you can get started on these projects right away&quot;</td>
