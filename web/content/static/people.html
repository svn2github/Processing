<p> <a href="http://benfry.com">Ben Fry</a> and <a href="http://reas.com">Casey 
Reas</a> are the co-founders of Processing and the primary designers of the language and software. The additional team leading the current push from Processing BETA to version 1.0 includes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/">Tom Carden</a>, Processing Hacks director<br />
  <a href="http://compartmental.net/">Damien Di Fede</a>, core sound library<br /> 
  <a href="http://www.iragreenberg.com/">Ira Greenberg</a>, master of ceremonies<br />
  <a href="http://www.florianjenett.de/">Florian Jenett</a>, design director and net burgermeister<br />
  <a href="http://brysonian.com/">Chandler McWilliams</a>, tools development<br />
  <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/">Andreas Schlegel</a>, library director<br />
  <a href="http://www.shiffman.net/">Dan Shiffman</a>, man about town and library consultant<br />
</p>
  
<p>The core Processing software is augmented by libraries contributed through the community. Inventive libraries are the bright future of this project. <a href="http://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/">A list of developers and their libraries is maintained here</a>. This contribution can't be underestimated. </p>

<p>
  We're always looking for people to <a href="http://processing.org/contribute/">join 
  in</a> and with the coming release of Processing version 1.0. We hope to distribute 
  the development of the project among a small group of dedicated individuals.<br /></p>
  
<p> Processing was started in Fall 2001 by Ben and Casey. Over the years, a growing number of people have been making additional contributions 
  to the project. (See the list below.) The current state of Processing would not be possible without 
  this shared effort. The Processing software is a community effort. It has evolved through a continuous conversation.<br />

<p>
  We give a special "Thank You!" to Sami Arola for writing the base of P3D, Simon 
  Greenwold for incorporting camera and lights into P3D, and Florian 
  Jenett for years of faithful service on the website.</p>
  
<p>Processing was first introduced to students through workshops. We're eternally 
  grateful to the first institutions who took a chance on our new software in 
  2001 and 2002: Musashino Art University (Tokyo), ENSCI Les Atelier (Paris), 
  HyperWerk (Basel), Royal Conservatory (Hague). Many universities have integrated 
  Processing into their curriculum and we're grateful to the pioneer faculty members 
  and students at these institutions. They are too numerous to mention here. The 
  students and faculty in New York University's Interactive Telecommunication 
  Program (ITP) deserve a special thank you for their early adoption and promotion. 
</p>

<p>We also thank the Open Source software developers of Jikes, JEdit, ORO Matcher, 
  and ANTLR. The Processing software is built upon their work.</p>
