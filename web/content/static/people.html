<p> <a href="http://benfry.com">Ben Fry</a> and <a href="http://reas.com">Casey 
  Reas</a> started Processing in Fall 2001 and have been co-developing it since. 
  Over the years, a growing number of people have been making additional contributions 
  to the project. The current state of the project wouldn't have been possible 
  without this assistance. We're always looking for people to <a href="http://processing.org/contribute/">join 
  in</a> and with the coming release of Processing version 1.0, we hope to distribute 
  the development of the project among a small group of dedicated individuals.<br />
  <br />
  We give a special "Thank You!" to Dan Mosedale for improving the parser, Sami 
  Arola for writing the base of P3D, Simon Greenwold for incorporting camera and 
  lights into P3D, and <a href="http://www.florianjenett.de/">Florian Jenett</a> 
  for years of faithful service on the website. We also thank Lenny Burdette for 
  converting the website to its current infrastructure.</p>
<p>Processing was first introduced to students through workshops. We're eternally 
  grateful to the first institutions who took a chance on our new software in 
  2001 and 2002: Musashino Art University (Tokyo), ENSCI Les Atelier (Paris), 
  HyperWerk (Basel), Royal Conservatory (Hague). Many universities have integrated 
  Processing into their curriculum and we're grateful to the pioneer faculty members 
  and students at these institutions. They are too numerous to mention here. The 
  students and faculty in New York University's Interactive Telecommunication 
  Program (ITP) deserve a special thank you for their early adoption and promotion. 
</p>
<p>The Processing software is a community effort. Over the last five years, the 
  software has evolved through a continuous conversation. It's impossible to make 
  a list of everyone who has collaborated and contributed. The people who have 
  formally contributed to the software includes Karsten Schmidt, Ariel Malka, 
  Martin Gomez, Mikkel Crone Koser, Koen Mostert, Timothy Mohn, Dan Mosedale, 
  Jacob Schwartz, Sami Arola, Dan Haskovec, and Jonathan Feinberg. The website 
  has been augmented by Lenny Burdette, Florian Jenett, Cem Uzunoglu, Dara Kilicoglu, 
  and Kevin Cannon. The reference has been translated to other languages by Willian 
  Ngan, Tori Tan, Mei Yu, Widianto Nugroho, Tetsu Kondo, Tai- Kyung Kim, Julien 
  Gachadoat, Pedro Alpera, Alessandro Capozzo, and Burak Arikan. As of 30 June 
  2006, code libraries have been generously contributed by Brendan Berg, Jeffrey 
  Traer Bernstein, Michael Chang, Stephane Cousot, Jeff Crouse, Kristian Linn 
  Damkjer, Daniel Dihardja, Julien Gachadoat, Simon Greenwold, Mark Hill, Florian 
  Jenett, JohnG, Jesse Kriss, Ariel Malka, Markavian, Allan William Martin, Josh 
  Nimoy, Krister Olsson, Amit Pitaru, Christian Riekoff, RSG, Carl-Johan Rosén, 
  Tatsuya Saito, Andreas Schlegel, Karsten Schmidt, Daniel Shiffman, Taka, and 
  Marius Watz. Tom Carden created www.processingblogs.org and together with Karsten 
  Schmidt created www.processinghacks.com. </p>
<p>We also thank the Open Source software developers of Jikes, JEdit, ORO Matcher, 
  and ANTLR. The Processing software is built upon their work.</p>
