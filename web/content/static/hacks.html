	There's a tremendous amount that you can do with Processing that extends beyond the officially supported language and environment. Processing Hacks is an effort to document some of the trickier and more advanced topics that Processing users are stumbling across as they gain experience and cross-fertilize their work with other platforms, languages, and libraries. This effort may be seen as a more stable complement to the Processing Discourse.<br />
	<br />
	Processing Hacks is a Wiki and contributions are encouraged. It is led by Tom Carden and Karsten Schmidt (aka toxi).
