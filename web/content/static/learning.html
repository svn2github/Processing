    <p>Processing was created to teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context, 
	to serve as a software sketchbook, and to be used as a production tool. This section of the website
	presents a series of examples that span this range. The examples are built to acclimate people to
	programming with Processing. For beginners, we recommend starting with one of the the books 
	listed to the right.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="basics/index.html">Basics:</a></strong> <br />
		Introducing the basic elements of computer programming and the fundamental components of the 
		processing language.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="topics/index.html">Topics:</a></strong> <br />
		Area such as animation, drawing, interaction, motion, simulation, file i/o, cellular automata, 
		fractals, and l-systems.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="3d/index.html">3D &amp; OpenGL:</a></strong> <br />
		Processing has two 3D renderers that can render 3D shapes on screen and can control lighting and 
		camera parameters. The P3D renderer is an optimized software renderer and the OPENGL renderer uses 
		JOGL to access to OpenGL accelerated graphics cards (this allows for an enormous speed improvement 
		on computers with supported graphics cards.)</p>

	<p><strong><a href="libraries/index.html">Libraries</a></strong> <br />
		The libraries built for Processing extend
		the software beyond graphics. They enable the software to capture and playback video, import SVG and 
		PDF files, communicate using the Internet and RS-232 protocols, create and playback sound files, and more...</p>
