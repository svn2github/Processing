    <br />This concise introduction to using Processing covers basic drawing, exporting, saving files, rendering to different contexts (2D, 3D, PDF), and talks about the ideas of &quot;sketching&quot; that underlie working with Processing.<br />

	<br /><a href="basics/"><b>Basic</b></a> examples introduce the primary elements of computer programming and the fundamental elements of drawing with  
		Processing. If you are new to programming, these examples can be a part of the learning process, 
		but they are not detailed or descriptive enough to be used alone. If you have prior experience, they 
        will show you how to apply what you know to using Processing.<br /></p>

	<p><a href="topics/"><b>Topic</b></a> examples build on the basics; they demonstate code for animation, drawing, interaction, interface, 
		motion, simulation, file i/o, cellular automata, fractals, and l-systems.</p>
		
    <p><a href="3d/"><b>3D</b></a> examples show the basics of drawing in 3D. Processing has two 3D renderers that can draw 3D shapes 
        on screen and control lighting and camera parameters. The P3D renderer is an optimized software renderer and the 
		OPENGL renderer uses JOGL to access OpenGL accelerated graphics cards (this creates an enormous speed improvement 
        on computers with supported graphics cards.)</p>

  <p><a href="libraries/"><b>Libraries</b></a> examples demonstrate how to use some of Processing's many libraries. The libraries enable Processing to capture and 
	   play video, import SVG files, export PDF files, communicate using the Internet and 
       RS-232 protocols, create and play sound files, and more...</p>
