		Processing.</p>

		Short programs related to animation, drawing, interaction, motion, simulation, file i/o, cellular automata,

	<p><strong><a href="3d/index.html">3D &amp; OpenGL</a></strong> <br />
		Processing has two 3D renderers that can draw 3D shapes on screen and control lighting and 
		camera parameters. The P3D renderer is an optimized software renderer and the OPENGL renderer uses 
		JOGL to access OpenGL accelerated graphics cards (this creates an enormous speed improvement 
		on computers with supported graphics cards.)</p>

	<p><strong><a href="libraries/index.html">Libraries</a></strong> <br />
		The libraries built for Processing extend the software beyond graphics. They enable the software to 
		capture and playback video, import SVG files, export PDF files, communicate using the Internet and 
		RS-232 protocols, create and playback sound files, and more...</p>

	<br />
	There's a tremendous amount that you can do with Processing that extends beyond the officially
	supported language and environment. Processing Hacks is an effort to document some of the trickier and more advanced topics 
	that Processing users are stumbling across as they gain experience and cross-fertilize their work with other platforms, 
	languages, and libraries. This effort may be seen as a more stable complement to the Processing Discourse.<br />
	<br />
	Processing Hacks is a Wiki and <em>contributions are encouraged</em>. It is led by Tom Carden and Karsten Schmidt (aka toxi).</p>
