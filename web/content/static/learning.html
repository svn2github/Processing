    <p>Processing was created to both teach fundamentals of computer programming within a visual context 
	and to be used as a production tool. This section of the website presents a few series of short examples 
	to get people of all skill levels started with using Processing. The books listed on the right have been 
	written primarily for beginners and intermediate-level programmers</p>

	<p><strong><a href="basics/index.html">Basics</a></strong> <br />
		Introducing the basic elements of computer programming and the fundamental components of 
		Processing.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="topics/index.html">Topics</a></strong> <br />
		Areas such as animation, drawing, interaction, motion, simulation, file i/o, cellular automata, 
		fractals, and l-systems.</p>

	<p><strong><a href="3d/index.html">3D &amp; OpenGL</a></strong> <br />
		Processing has two 3D renderers that can render 3D shapes on screen and control lighting and 
		camera parameters. The P3D renderer is an optimized software renderer and the OPENGL renderer uses 
		JOGL to access OpenGL accelerated graphics cards (this creates an enormous speed improvement 
		on computers with supported graphics cards.)</p>

	<p><strong><a href="libraries/index.html">Libraries</a></strong> <br />
		The libraries built for Processing extend the software beyond graphics. They enable the software to 
		capture and playback video, import SVG files, export PDF files, communicate using the Internet and 
		RS-232 protocols, create and playback sound files, and more...</p>
