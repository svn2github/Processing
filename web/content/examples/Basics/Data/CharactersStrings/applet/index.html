Characters Strings. 

Click on the image to give it focus and then type letters to
shift the location of the image. 
Characters are typographic symbols such as A, d, and %.  
The character datatype, abbreviated as char, stores letters and 
symbols in the Unicode format, a coding system developed to support 
a variety of world languages. Characters are distinguished from other
symbols by putting them between single quotes ('P'). 
A string is a sequence of characters. A string is noted by surrounding 
a group of letters with double quotes ("Processing"). 
Chars and strings are most often used with the keyboard methods, 
to display text to the screen, and to load images or files.
