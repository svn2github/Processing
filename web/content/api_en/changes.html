Release 0116 contains many changes, frameRate(), beginShape(), 
and endShape() are the biggest ones.

<UL>

<LI> framerate() is now called frameRate(), for better API consistency.
  It didn't make sense to have a frameCount variable and a framerate()
  method as its misshapen cousin. 

<LI> The default frameRate is now 60 fps. This will prevent some odd
  quirks with sketches running faster than they need to and throttling
  the resources of your machine. To disable this, you can set the 
  frameRate arbitrarily high.

<LI> beginShape() has changed. LINE_LOOP and LINE_STRIP have been 
  removed because they are redundant, and not consistent with the 
  rest of the API. beginShape(POLYGON) is no longer recommended, 
  simply use beginShape() with no parameters when drawing an
  irregular shape. Code examples:
<PRE>

  OLD SYNTAX:
  beginShape(POLYGON);
  // call vertex() several times
  endShape()

  NEW SYNTAX:
  beginShape();
  // call vertex() several times
  endShape(CLOSE);

</PRE>
  endShape() with the CLOSE parameter will make the stroke on your
  shape continue back to where the shape started. This is the same
  way that POLYGON and LINE_LOOP worked.
<PRE>

  OLD_SYNTAX:
  beginShape(LINE_STRIP);
  // draw with vertex()
  endShape();

  NEW SYNTAX:
  noFill();
  beginShape();
  // draw with vertex();
  endShape();

</PRE>
  In the above case, noFill() must be called, and the CLOSE parameter 
  to endShape() is not used, because the last point should not come 
  back to meet the original point.
<PRE>

  OLD SYNTAX:
  beginShape(LINE_LOOP);
  // draw with vertex()
  endShape();

  NEW SYNTAX:
  noFill();
  beginShape();
  // draw with vertex();
  endShape(CLOSE);

</PRE>
  For the LINE_LOOP example, endShape(CLOSE) is used to specify close the
  shape. noFill() must also be called, so that the shape is not filled in.
<br /> 
  The two main problems with the old API were 1) LINE_LOOP was simply a 
  POLYGON with no fill setting, this made for a strange inconsistency.
  2) there was no way to draw a non-closed POLYGON shape. 
<br />
  Using beginShape(POLYGON) doesn't make much sense when you're drawing 
  a line, so this is one more reason that beginShape() with no parameters
  is recommended.

<LI> The single pixel blend() methods have been removed, they were 
  overkill. Also, the blend() function that blends a color, instead
  of image data, is now called blendColor().

<LI> Along with blendColor(), a lerpColor() method has been added.
  It works just like lerp()... but with colors!

<LI> writer() and reader() are now createWriter() and createReader().
  These weren't really documented, so the change doesn't officially
  "count" per se, but maybe someone was using 'em.

<LI> toInt() and toFloat() are now parseInt() and parseFloat(), 
  to change to JavaScript syntax. Not sure if anyone was using these.

<LI> Text with the JAVA2D setting no longer uses native fonts by default,
  which means they'll be slower and uglier. See the reference for
  textFont() for details and how it can be addressed.

<LI> Threading has been modified signficantly. Some of these changes 
  had to be undone at the last minute, so further changes are coming.
  The changes will fix several strange InterruptedException problems.

<LI> The PGraphics classes have all been reworked and renamed.

<UL>
  <LI> PGraphics is an abstract class on which additional PGraphics
    subclasses can be built. It is an abstract class, and therefore
    cannot be invoked directly. 

  <LI> PGraphics2D (P2D) contains the former contents of PGraphics that 
    are specific to 2D rendering. This will be P2D once it is complete.

  <LI> PGraphics3D (P3D), formerly PGraphics3, remains mostly unchanged.

  <LI> PGraphicsJava2D (JAVA2D), formerly PGraphics2, is the renderer 
    used when you call for size(width, height, JAVA2D). It remains 
    the default renderer when none is specified. It is slower but 
    more accurate than the others.
</UL>

<LI> Do not use "new PGraphics" to create PGraphics objects.
  Instead, use createGraphics(), which will properly handle connecting
  the new graphics object to its parent sketch, and will enable save()
  to work properly. See the reference for <A HREF="http://processing.org/reference/createGraphics_.html">createGraphics</A>
  
<LI> For the same reasons as above, createImage(width, height, format) 
  should be used instead of "new PImage" when <A HREF="http://processing.org/reference/createImage_.html">creating images</A>

<LI> PImage objects default to ARGB instead of RGB format. This is 
  helpful for using createImage() or createGraphics() to generate
  a transparent surface. Be sure to use PNG or another format that
  supports alpha.

<LI> beginFrame() and endFrame() are now beginDraw() and endDraw(). 
  Use these around drawing commands to a PGraphics created by
  createGraphics(). The defaults() method should not/need not
  be called, just beginDraw() and endDraw().
</UL>

	   <h5 id="alpha"><a href="#top"><img src="environment/images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> Changes between Alpha (Release 0069) and Beta (Release 0085)</h5>

       <p>Between revision 0069 (the last public alpha) and the beta release (0085), 
many, many functions have been added, and are detailed in the 
<a href="http://processing.org/reference/index_ext.html">complete
      reference</a>. Aside from that, this page lists functions whose
      names have changed or fundamental API differences between the
      two versions.
<UL>
<LI>loop() has been removed, and is instead called draw(). If you want
applications to only run draw() once (the way draw() used to work), 
use the function noLoop() inside of setup().
<LI>size() should now be the very first thing in your setup(),
otherwise commands that come before it may be ignored. your settings for 
fill() and stroke(), for instance, will disappear after you call size(). 
<LI>2D and 3D graphics are no longer completely mixed. To specify
3D graphics, instead of size(200, 200), the new way is to use
size(200, 200, P3D). 

<LI>BImage &rarr; PImage, BFont &rarr; PFont, and so on... 
<LI>For advanced users who were making their own BGraphics objects in
the previous release:
<PRE>BGraphics bg = new BGraphics(200, 200);
// has now become
PGraphics pg = new PGraphics2(200, 200, null);
pg.defaults(); // clear the buffer, get it ready</PRE>We didn't realize
quite how many people were using this, so we'll probably add a
createGraphics() method because PGraphics2 may be temporary (instead
of just PGraphics), and the "null" thing is pretty weird. Even still,
this isn't quite working as expected, but it's a high priority to fix
for the future, see <NOBR><A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=92">Bug 92</A></NOBR>
for the status.
<LI>The new renderers might be slower for some things, faster for others.
If you want faster pixel operations, try using P3D (until P2D is available
again). For high-quality lines and strokeWeight() and strokeCap(), use
JAVA2D (the default). 
<LI>To use OpenGL rendering, change that to size(200, 200, OPENGL),
and use Sketch &rarr; Import Library &rarr; opengl. OpenGL support is
incomplete, but allows for much larger screen sizes and accelerated
graphics that make use of a decent graphics card. 

<LI>When using the pixels[] array of the main window, or on an image,
you should first call loadPixels(), and once you're done editing, call
updatePixels(). This is because the new JAVA2D and OPENGL renderers both need to post-process the image data before displaying it, which is a time-consuming operation. 
<LI>Library events are handled differently because more than one
serial port or video input device can be used with Processing
beta. See the documentation for 
<a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/movieEvent_.html">movieEvent</a>, 
<a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/video/captureEvent_.html">captureEvent</a>, and
<a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/serial/serialEvent_.html">serialEvent</a>.
Documentation for clientEvent and serverEvent for network will also
eventually be linked from <a
href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/net/index.html">this page</a>.
<LI>push() &rarr; pushMatrix()
<LI>pop() &rarr; popMatrix()
<LI>textureMode(NORMAL_SPACE) &rarr; textureMode(NORMALIZED)

<LI>textureMode(IMAGE_SPACE) &rarr; textureMode(IMAGE)
<LI>textMode(ALIGN_LEFT) &rarr; textAlign(LEFT)
<LI>textMode(ALIGN_RIGHT) &rarr; textAlign(RIGHT)
<LI>textMode(ALIGN_CENTER) &rarr; textAlign(CENTER)
<LI>textSpace(SCREEN_SPACE) &rarr; textMode(SCREEN)
<LI>textSpace(OBJECT_SPACE) &rarr; textMode(MODEL)

<LI>font.width(String s) &rarr; textWidth(String s)
<LI>font.ascent() &rarr; textAscent()
<LI>font.descent() &rarr; textDescent()
<LI>fonts should now be more accurately sized, if your font sizing looks weird, try using "Create Font" to create a new font using the most recent release of Processing. It's strongly suggested that you do this when updated projects from alpha to beta. 
<LI>the function alpha(), when used to create an alpha mask of an image, is now <A HREF="../reference/PImage_mask_.html">mask()</A>, to remove a conflict with the alpha() function that extracts the alpha value of a color.
<LI>previous default was ellipseMode(CORNER) &rarr; now it's ellipseMode(CENTER)
<LI>RGBA for images &rarr; ARGB (more technically accurate)

<LI>CENTER_DIAMETER &rarr; CENTER
<LI>objectX, objectY, objectZ &rarr; modelX, modelY, modelZ
<LI>curveSegments() &rarr; curveDetail()
<LI>bezierSegments() &rarr; bezierDetail()
<LI>splitStrings() &rarr; split() (changed in rev 0069)
<LI>splitInts() &rarr; toInt(split()) (changed in rev 0069)

<LI>splitFloats() &rarr; toFloat(split()) (changed in rev 0069)
<LI>angleMode() has been removed. Radians are used for all functions. 
If you don't like radians, you can convert to radians to degrees via the radians() function, i.e.: sin(radians(90)).
<LI>four calls to bezierVertex(x, y) should instead be a single call
to vertex(x, y), followed by bezierVertex(cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2, x2, y2)
(two control points followed by the destination point). 
<LI>The libraries for serial, video, and network have changed
completely. Check out the examples or visit the <A HREF="../reference/libraries/index.html">libraries reference</A> for the full details.
<!--<LI>&hellip;anything else that we've forgotten in our hastiness and we'll be adding over the next few days and weeks. If you find something that we've missed, please <A HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=WebsiteBugs">let us know</A>.-->
