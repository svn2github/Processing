      Supported Platforms</h5>
    <p>The Processing Development Environment (PDE) is "officially" tested with:
<OL>
<LI>Mac OS X 10.4 (PPC and Intel)
<LI>Windows XP
<LI>Fedora Core 4 (Linux)
</OL>
These are the operating systems that are on machines at the Processing Release Testing And Quality Assurance Center (the PRTAQAC, which bears a suspicious resemblance to the living room of Ben's apartment). Builds usually get the most testing on OS X, and a cursory test on Windows and Linux. If you run into trouble, you've gotta let us know, the PRTAQAC is badly understaffed. 
 </p>

    <h5 id="windows"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Windows</h5>
	<p>Windows is by far the superior platform for running Java
applications. It's not because we like Windows the best but that's
just how it is. 
<br> <br>
The release is split into versions with and without Java. The non-Java
      version is only recommended for people who know what they're
      doing and have Java 1.4 installed. If you have trouble getting
      Processing to run properly, one of the first things you should
      try is downloading the version that includes Java, rather than
      the one without.
<br> <br>

Windows 95/98/ME is a piece of crap, but since lots of people (are
often forced to) use it, we'll do our best to support it. Windows 95 is
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/win95.xml">not supported</a>.
Releases seem to often have trouble with 98/ME, so if possible, we
<em>strongly</em> recommend using Windows 2000 or XP. We won't be
testing on 95/98/ME or supporting it any more than we absolutely must.</p>
	
	<h5 id="mac"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Mac OS x</h5>
	<p>Java on Mac OS X is steadily improving (especially
when compared to Apple's previous efforts), but it's still far slower
than Windows and even the older Java that ran on Mac OS Classic.
We think OS X will be a great bet for the future, and Apple is
putting all their feeble weight behind it, hopefully it will evolve
somewhere. Java performance on the Intel Macs is improved significantly. 
Hopefully improvements in stability and keeping the
releases up to date are not far behind. Unfortunately Apple seems to
have a somewhat arrogant attitude about Java and wants everyone to
code their applications using things like Cocoa, perhaps missing the
point of their current marketshare.
<br> <br>
<UL>
<LI>Like all applications that also support the Intel Macs, Processing requires
Mac OS X 10.3.9 or later. Unfortunately, we cannot support any earlier releases. OS X 10.2 and earlier are problematic and 10.3 should be updated to 10.3.9 anyways, if nothing else to take advantage of security updates. 
<LI>If you're using an earlier version of OS X than 10.3.9, Processing will not run and you may get an error like this one in your Console.app: <TT>dyld: Processing 0108/Processing 0108.app/Contents/MacOS/JavaApplicationStub can't open library: /usr/lib/libgcc_s.1.dylib  (No such file or directory, errno = 2)</TT>. 
<LI>The most current release is tested (and supported) only on the latest 
update of Mac OS X 10.4.x. Earlier versions of 10.4 have trouble with OpenGL
and include other nasty bugs.
<LI>We will only fix bugs specific to 10.3.9 if there's a specific issue raised 
and it can be done without too  much trouble. We still intend to support 10.3.9 for a while (but not earlier 10.3.x
releases). <!--Your mileage may vary if you're running something else. 
Actually, your mileage will vary no matter what, because who knows what this
software is gonna do. You're playing with free, beta-quality software. 
Get psyched!-->
<LI>If you're having trouble with Mac OS X, check the console. It's found in Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Console.app. Information posted there may tell you what the problem is, or provide an error message that someone (perhaps from the discourse section of the Processing site) can help with.

<LI>As of January 2006, OS X 10.4 will also be the primary development platform instead of Windows XP. 
<LI>Using Java 1.5 (J2SE 5.0) is <A HREF="#java">not recommended</A>, 
but is perhaps a losing battle. 
<LI>When using OS X 10.4, it's common to get errors in the console that read something like: <BR>
<TT>2006-03-30 15:27:47.118 java[1170] CFLog (0): CFMessagePort: bootstrap_register(): failed 1103 (0x44f), port = 0x11303, name = 'java.ServiceProvider'<BR>
See /usr/include/servers/bootstrap_defs.h for the error codes.<BR>
2006-03-30 15:27:47.119 java[1170] CFLog (99): CFMessagePortCreateLocal(): failed to name Mach port (java.ServiceProvider)</TT> <BR>
This is an Apple bug that shows up any time that more than one instance of Java is running. I'm baffled that they haven't fixed this issue. 
<!--<LI>As of revision 0104, Mac OS X version 10.3.9 is the minimum version that will run Processing. Unfortunately, we cannot support any earlier releases. OS X 10.2 is problematic and 10.3 should be updated to 10.3.9 anyways, if nothing else to take advantage of security updates. -->
<!--<LI>On Mac OS X 10.3, be sure to use Software Update to update to the most recent version of Java 1.4. Early releases had several problems (i.e. "Present" mode being broken) In addition, the Mac OS X 10.3.9 update causes Processing to crash on startup, or might cause Safari to crash when running Java applets. 
Apple has fixed the issue with 
<a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301382">this
update</a> which is also available from the Software Update Control
Panel. Bottom line, just keep your machine up to date and you should
be all set.-->
<!--<LI><STRIKE>Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar) is the minimum version that will run the Processing environment. If you want to run Processing itself on Mac OS X 10.2, you must install Java 1.4 via Software Update, and in fact, install absolutely everything available to get you up to 10.2.8, and all the security fixes. Revision 85 did not run properly on 10.2, but this has been fixed for 86. "Present" mode does not work on 10.2 because of apparent bugs in Apple's implementation of Java's full screen mode.</STRIKE> As of release 0104, Mac OS X 10.3.9 is required to run the Processing environment.-->

<LI>Mac OS X 10.0, 10.1, and 10.2 won't run the Processing environment, but should run applets that have been created with it. Make sure that Java is as up-to-date as possible (via Software Update). 
<LI>Mac OS 9 was a big headache, and we badly wanted to support it (since many people still use it), but discontinued support for lack of time. As of revision 85, applets exported from Processing won't work on Mac OS 9 either, but that should return with a future release.
</UL>
Notes about Processing on Intel Macs:
<UL>
<LI>With the release of the affordable Mac Mini for Intel, we were
able to purchase one of these cute little fellers and start testing
Processing releases with it. The machine arrived exactly 24 hours from
when Stever left the stage, and we're working hard to make sure that
Processing for OS X on Intel is available way before Adobe has a chance 
to charge you another $1200 for the Intel-native Creative Suite 3.
<LI>Performance on the Intel Macs is <EM>significantly</EM> better than 
earlier PowerPC Macs. The only exception is that the Mac Mini and MacBook
(unlike its predecessor the iBook) use an integrated graphics chipset, 
so OpenGL performance may not see as much of a boost.
<LI>While older releases will run on the
Mactel machines, starting with revision 0104, the Processing
application itself is a Universal Binary. Release 0110 is the first to
support the OPENGL renderer on the Intel Macs. Release 0111 adds serial
support with a Universal version of the RXTX library.
<LI>Java, thankfully, is already native on the new Intel Macs, so the
improvement that comes from the faster bus/processor is a big help.
And the ways in which the Intel chips aren't faster than PPC (Altivec,
heavy media stuff) should have little effect on Java/Processing (yes,
contradictory, since we're doing graphics things, right? but I don't
have the impression that Java was optimized heavily to use Altivec and
media hooey that's lost on the Mactels). 
<LI>The ever-popular <A HREF="http://pitaru.com/sonia/">Sonia</A> library
does not run on the Intel Macs because jSyn, upon which Sonia is based, 
is not yet a Universal Binary.
<LI><!--<STRIKE>The serial library still has not been ported to a Universal Binary.
I spent some time building rxtx to be a universal binary, but who
knows what sort of endian issues lurk underneath and I haven't had
time to test the thing since getting an Intel Mac.</STRIKE>-->

The serial library included with releases 0111 and later is now a 
Universal Binary (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=311">Bug 311</A>).
You may need to re-run macosx_setup.command script to get serial working
properly on your machine. After running the setup script, shutdown and 
restart your machine. For more information, see the <A HREF="../libraries/serial/index.html">serial</A> section of the FAQ.

      Linux</h5>
	<p>
	For the Linux version, you guys can support yourselves. If you're
enough of a hacker weenie to get a linux box set up, you oughta know
what's going on. For lack of time, we won't be testing extensively
under linux, but would be really happy to hear about any bugs or
issues you might run into. Actually, we don't get happy that you're
having issues, but if you're going to have issues, we're happy that
you tell us about them, so we can fix them.
<br> <br>
The Processing application is just a shell script, you can use this
as a guide to getting Processing to run with your specific configuration,
because who knows what sort of setup you have. this release was tested
on a Fedora Core 3, and Sun's Java Runtime Environment 1.4.2 is
included with the download. Replacing (or making a symlink to) the
contents of the &lsquo;java&rsquo; folder will let you tie in a
preferred Java VM for your machine.
<br> <br>
Getting Processing to run on Linux can be tricky, mostly because of Jikes. 
Some information on getting it to work can be found 
<a href="../troubleshooting.html#wontstart">here</a> under the Linux section. Similar to 
the Java folder, you can symlink a proper jikes in place of the distributed
version and you should be all set. However make sure that you're using 
Jikes 1.22, otherwise things may not work properly.
<br> <br>

If anyone out there knows how to properly build a version of Jikes that's 
compatible across all (or at least a wide range of) distros, please 
<a href="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=Collaboration">let us know</a>. We're not Linux gurus so we don't know all the tricks.
<br> <br>
Using Fedora Core 4, I had to install compat-libstdc++-33 and xorg-x11-deprecated-libs in order to get things to run properly with the current distribution. Let's hear it for library dependencies!

      Other Platforms</h5>
	<p>
Because Processing is written in Java, it should run on any platform
      that supports Java 1.4. If you'd like to get it running on BSD,
      Irix, AmigaOS, BeOS... whatever, you should download the Linux
      version, and replace the &ldquo;java&rdquo; folder and jikes application
      with versions that support your platform. Then mess with the
      shell script to get things up and running. </p>
	
	<h5 id="java"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Java Versions</h5>
	<p>
      There are several versions of Java, each with a different story. The versions 
      from 1.2 to 1.4 are also referred to with names like "Java 2 SDK 1.2" or 
      "J2SE 1.4" (Java 2 Standard Edition 1.4). J2SE is different from the trimmed-down 
      J2ME ("Micro Edition") which runs on mobile devices, and J2EE ("Enterprise 
      Edition") which contains more "enterprise" related bloat. In a moment of 
      further anti-user marketing genius, Sun recently decided to call the latest 
      release "Java 5.0" when promoting, but it's Java 1.5 to developers. Awesome! <UL> 
      <LI>Java 1.0 &mdash; a long, long time ago in 1995&hellip;

<LI>Java 1.1 &mdash; this was the first truly usable version of
Java. It's the last version of Java that was supported by Microsoft,
but has since been discontinued because of a lawsuit by Sun. Informal
estimates show that about 40% of web users that are using Java are 
still using Java 1.1. As of beta, Processing does not support 1.1 (it
requires 1.3) but we hope that this is only a temporary change,
because 1.1 support is obviously important.
<LI>Java 1.2 &mdash; was a mess, and was mercifully replaced by 1.3.
<LI>Java 1.3 &mdash; took all the features added in 1.2 and made them
usable. This is the current minimum required installation for
applets exported from Processing beta. Java 1.3 (and 1.4) is installed
on all Mac OS X machines. Windows users must download from 
<a href="http://java.com">java.com</a>. Because the Java plug-in on
Windows urges people to upgrade to 1.4 or 1.5, very few people appear
to be using 1.3 on the web any more. 
<LI>Java 1.4 &mdash; this is required for running the
Processing environment itself, and the one that receives the most
testing from us. It is the version of Java that is included with the
Windows download of Processing.
Java 1.4 is also installed by default on Mac OS X. 
Windows users must download from <a
href="http://java.com">java.com</a>.
It's used by about a 30%
of the people with Java installed.
Most Linux users will have Java 1.4 or later if it is installed.
<LI>Java 1.5 &mdash; the very latest version of Java. We don't support it and recommend that you avoid using it, as we don't test with it and it appears that it may be the slowest (certainly most bloated) release of Java yet. For instance, if you have Java 1.5 installed but are using the Processing download that includes Java, you may be surprised to see that things run more slowly when run in a browser than when run from inside Processing itself. It is also not possible to use any of the new syntax introduced in Java 1.5 within Processing, even if you have 1.5 installed (the preprocessor and compiler used by Processing don't understand the 1.5 syntax). Unfortunately, 1.5 still accounts for about 30% of the people (almost entirely Windows users) who have Java installed.
For Mac OS X 10.4, it was (at least initially) released as a separate
download, and will not be available on anything earlier than 10.4. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=175">Bug 175</A>)

<LI>Java 1.6 &mdash; I dread the day that this beast, known as
"Tiger", will leap from his cage in Santa Clara. I fear for the way
this Tiger will claw away at my time and productivity and leave me a
carcass of RSI and frustration. Sun in their infinite awesomeness has
decided that they've really been having trouble stuffing the JDK
releases full of enough bloat and confusing the market to the full
extent their capable, so they've
accelerated the release schedule for Java 1.6 to arrive much sooner
than the gap between Java 1.4 and 1.5. I'm sorry, I mean the time
between the release of Java 2 Standard Edition and Java 2 Standard
Edition 5.0. They were originally targeting <EM>nine months</EM>,
though it doesn't look like they're gonna make it. The 68 MB footprint
of the Java 1.5 runtime just doesn't cut the mustard anymore, nor do
the 12,931 class files in the runtime jar file. Plus, the new syntax
features of Java 1.5 just don't feel like it's quite as confusing as
C++ yet, so I'm sure we can get a little further out on snorting the
syntactic sugar. I'm starting a betting pool on how bloated and buggy
this thing will be, the loser has to moon either Scott McNealy or James
Gosling, chosen at the discretion of the winners. Or if they add
#define to the syntax, that means we all lose and have to switch to C#
and Visual Studio.</ul></p>
