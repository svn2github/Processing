    <h2>OpenGL</h2>
    
    <p>OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform graphics interface for 
      3D and 2D graphics. This library allows Processing programs to utilize the 
      speed of an OpenGL accelerated graphics card. This expands the potential 
      for drawing more to the screen and creating larger windows. Processing interfaces 
      with OpenGL through JOGL, an initiative from the Game Technology Group at 
      Sun. You need to have an OpenGL accelerated graphics card installed on your 
      computer to fully utilize this library. For more information, please visit 
      the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/" target="_new">OpenGL</a> and <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/" target="_new">JOGL</a> websites.</p>
      
    <p>There are no additional methods or fields for this library. It uses the 
        Processing language, but exports the geometry differently. Programs must 
        import the library using the line <em>import processing.opengl.*</em> and 
        the OpenGL renderer must be specified as the third parameter to the size() 
        function. Software using this library may appear different on varying graphics 
        cards. Some cards support OpenGL better than others.</p>
        
          
    <pre>import processing.opengl.*;

float a; 

void setup() {
  size(800, 600, OPENGL);
  fill(0, 153);
  noStroke();
}

void draw() {
  background(255);
  translate(width/2, height/2);
  rotateX(a);
  rotateY(a*2);
  rect(-200, -200, 400, 400);
  rotateX(PI/2);
  rect(-200, -200, 400, 400);
  a += 0.01;

<h6>OpenGL Issues</h6>
<p><UL>
<LI><EM>Try updating your drivers</EM></A>. 
If you're getting a blank screen with sketch that uses OpenGL, 
or the sketch is hanging or starting very slowly, you likely need to
update your drivers. Release 0110 and later use a newer version of
<A HREF="http://jogl.dev.java.net">JOGL</A>, which requires a software
update for some video cards. On Windows, updated drivers are available
from your machine's vendor, Windows Update, or the manufacturer of
your graphics card. On Mac OS X, use Software Update to make sure your
system is up to date. For instance, OS X 10.4.2 has problems with 
0110+ that are fixed in later releases of 10.4.x.

<LI>We don't recommend running other OpenGL programs while running
  Processing in OpenGL mode. GL tends takes charge of things so
  results will be unexpected (windows from the other app showing
  through to the Processing window, etc.)

<LI>OpenGL is really memory hungry because of how textures work. In
OpenGL mode, your images as the next power of two larger in either
direction. This means an image that's 40x190 pixels will be stored as
a 64x256 pixel x 4 bytes per pixel array (along with the original
image storage being width x height x 4). This is probably something we
can optimize in the future, however no attempt will be made until the
surrounding code is debugged. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=150">Bug 150</A>)

<LI><STRIKE>OpenGL sketches cannot be exported to run in a browser. The export
probably won't give an error, but they won't run properly. It's not
clear whether this is something that we can fix for the future.</STRIKE>
OpenGL sketches run on the web starting with release 0113.
(<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=166">Bug 166</A>)

<LI>OpenGL requires Java 1.4 or later. 

<LI>If you're getting a blank screen or strange graphics on Windows, 
try messing with your graphics card settings (or even with a different
graphics card). There are lots of options that can cause trouble (if
you run into such a situation, please post to the board on how you got
it fixed).

<LI>If you're getting this error on Windows: 

<tt>"net.java.games.jogl.GLException: Unable to enumerate pixel formats 
  of window using wglGetPixelFormatAttribivARB: 0"</tt>
and your machine has built in "Intel" graphics (this is the case for 
  many Dell machines, for instance) you may just need an updated version 
  of your driver, which can be found 
<a href="http://downloadfinder.intel.com/scripts-df/Detail_Desc.asp?sType=prev&agr=N&ProductID=865&DwnldID=7919">here</a>. 
Of course, read the page closely and make sure that you in fact have
this graphics chipset on your machine before installing. Thanks to
Daniel Shiffman for finding this fix.

<LI><STRIKE>On Mac OS X, I don't think there's much we can do about the
  following error: <tt>Error: view not ready, cannot lock focus at 
  "/Users/kbr/JavaNet/jogl/src/native/jogl/
   MacOSXWindowSystemInterface.m:createContext:51"</tt>
  that shows up sometimes on Run. Just hit Run again and things oughta
  work. This may be our bug, but who knows.</STRIKE> "Cannot lock
  focus" bug on OS X is fixed for Processing release 93, thanks to
  toxi for tracking it down as fixed with a new JOGL release.

<LI>On Windows, if you're getting a lot of OpenGL crashing, blue
screens, or other mess, your driver might be bad (really!) 
For instance, if you're using a Dell, use the driver they provide 
(<a href="http://support.dell.com">support.dell.com</a>) instead of what
might be a more recent driver obtained directly from nvidia.com.
</ul>

<h6>Using the OpenGL Renderer</h6>
<p><em>Generally, this should be only considered a last-ditch way to get at a particular 
  GL-specific feature.</em> It makes your code completely incompatible with everything 
  else (such as future versions of Processing, or other 3D renderers) and will 
  confuse the hell outta people when you post your code to the web. Again, if 
  this works for you great, but if not, we will not field questions about it on 
  the board. If you want to write code for Java and JOGL, then find yourself a 
  good Java IDE and get JOGL installed, Processing is not the way to do it. Man, 
  how I'm gonna regret this.</p>
<p>To get access to the GL object, use the following:
<PRE>GL gl = ((PGraphicsOpenGL)g).gl;</PRE>
  <p>This will give you the <a href="https://jogl.dev.java.net/">jogl</a> object 
    that talks directly to OpenGL and will let you make OpenGL calls directly. 
    Note, however, that <em>this is not supported</em>, in the sense that if you 
    get weird problems with a GL-based sketch that uses this method, you're on 
    your own. Processing is not intended as a nice wrapper on top of OpenGL. Instead, 
    we're using OpenGL graphics for one implementation of the Processing Core 
    API. <BR>
    Because most of the work in drawing is handled by Processing, most OpenGL 
    calls will not work, because the model and perspective matrices won't be set 
    up properly. Therefore, using the GL object will mostly only be useful for 
    tweaking obscure OpenGL parameters.</p>
  <p>Another option for talking directly to OpenGL in release 0116 and later is 
    to use the beginGL() and endGL() methods. These were added against my better 
    judgement, and handle setting up the camera matrices. Many features still 
    will not work, but it opens up lots of control for geometry. </p>

import javax.media.opengl.*;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400, OPENGL);
}

void draw() {
  PGraphicsOpenGL pgl = (PGraphicsOpenGL) g;
  GL gl = pgl.beginGL();
  // do some things with gl.xxx functions here
  pgl.endGL();
}
