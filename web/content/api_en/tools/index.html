<i>The following tools are included with the Processing software. To add one to a project, select its name from the "Import Library..." option in the Sketch menu. These libraries are open source; the code is distributed with Processing.</i></p>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5>Auto Format</h5>
    <p>Attempts to format the code into a more human-readable layout. Auto Format 
      was previously called Beautify. It can be run using the key shortcut Ctrl-T  
      (Apple-T on Mac).</p>
      
          
    <h5>Archive Sketch</h5>
    <p>Archives a copy of the current sketch in .zip format. The archive is placed in 
    the same directory as the sketch.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5>Color Selector</h5>
    <p>Simple interface for selecting colors as RGB, HSB, and Hex.</p>

    <h5>Create Font</h5>
    <p>Converts fonts into the Processing font format and adds to the current sketch. 
      Opens a dialog box which give options for setting the font, its size, if 
      it is anti-aliased, and if all characters should be generated. If the "All 
      Characters" options is selected, non-English characters such as ü and Å 
      are generated, but the font file is larger in size. The amount of memory 
      required for the font is also determined by the size selected. Processing 
      fonts are textures, so larger fonts require more image data.</p>
      
</div>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5>Fix Encoding &amp; Reload</h5>
    <p>Sketches that contain non-ASCII characters and were saved with Processing 0140 
    and earlier may look strange when opened. Garbled text and odd characters may appear
    where umlauts, cedillas, and Japanese formerly lived. This will reload your sketch 
    using the same method as previous versions of Processing, at which point you can 
    re-save it which will write a proper UTF-8 version.</p>
