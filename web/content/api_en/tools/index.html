<p class="libraries-top">
<i>The following tools are included with the Processing software. Select the tool you want to use from the Tools menu of the Processing Environment. These tools are open source; the code is distributed with Processing.</i></p>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5>Auto Format</h5>
    <p>Attempts to format the code into a more human-readable layout. It
    adds and removes spaces to make the structure of the code clear.</p>
          
    <h5>Archive Sketch</h5>
    <p>Archives a copy of the current sketch in .zip format. The archive is placed in 
    the same directory as the sketch.</p>
   
</div>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5>Color Selector</h5>
    <p>Simple interface for selecting colors as RGB, HSB, and Hex values.</p>

    <h5>Create Font</h5>
    <p>Converts fonts into the Processing font format and adds to the current sketch. 
      Opens a dialog box which give options for setting the font, its size, if 
      it is anti-aliased, and if all characters should be generated.</p>
      
</div>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5>Fix Encoding &amp; Reload</h5>
    <p>Sketches that contain non-ASCII characters and were saved with Processing 0140 
    and earlier may look strange when opened. Garbled text and odd characters may appear
    where umlauts, cedillas, and Japanese formerly lived. This will reload your sketch 
    using the same method as previous versions of Processing, at which point you can 
    re-save it which will write a proper UTF-8 version.</p>

<p class="libraries-bottom">
Contributed tools must be downloaded separately and placed within a "tools" folder of your Processing sketchbook. (To find the Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the Processing application and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top.) Copy the contributed tools's folder into the "tools" folder at this location. <em>You will need to create the "tools" folder if this is your first contributed library</em>. Follow the links below for more information about each tool.<br />
<br />
Contributed libraries are developed, documented, and maintained by members of the Processing community. For feedback and support, please post to the <a href="http://processing.org/discourse">Discourse</a>, for development discussions post to <a href="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_libraries_tools">Libraries, Tool Development</a>. Instructions for creating your own tool are on the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/tools/">Develop Processing</a> site.<br /><br />
