<p class="libraries-top">
The following libraries are included with the Processing software. To add one to a project, select its name from the "Import Library..." option in the Sketch menu. These libraries are open source; the code is distributed with Processing.</p>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5><a href="video/index.html">Video</a></h5>
    <p>Interface to Apple's QuickTime for using a camera, playing movie files, and creating movies.</p>
        
	<h5><a href="net/index.html">Network</a></h5>
    <p>Sending and receiving data via the Internet through the creation of simple clients and servers.</p>
	
    <h5><a href="serial/index.html">Serial</a></h5>
    <p>Supports sending data between Processing and external hardware via serial communication (RS-232).</p>
    	
	<h5><a href="pdf/index.html">PDF Export</a></h5>
    <p>Generates PDF files.</p>
</div>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5><a href="opengl/index.html">OpenGL</a></h5>
    <p>Support for exporting OpenGL accelerated sketches. Utilizes the JOGL library.</p>
    
 	<h5><a href="http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/">&raquo; Minim</a></h5>
    <p>Uses the JavaSound API to provide an easy-to-use audio library. A simple API while 
    still providing a reasonable amount of flexibility for more advanced users.</p>
    
    <h5><a href="dxf/index.html">DXF Export</a></h5>
    <p>Lines and triangles from P3D or OPENGL rendering modes can be sent directly to a DXF file. </p>
</div>

<div class="threecol">
    <h5><a href="http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/Processing" target="_new">&raquo; Arduino</a></h5>
    <p>Allows direct control of an Arduino board through Processing.</p>
    
    <h5><a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/LiveConnect_Overview" target="_new">&raquo; Netscape.JavaScript</a></h5>
    <p>Methods for interfacing between Javascript and Java Applets exported from Processing.</p>
       
	<h5>Candy SVG Import</h5>
    <p>This library has been moved to the Processing core code as of version 149. To load
    SVG files, check out the reference for PShape(), loadShape(), and shape().</p>
	
	<h5>XML Import</h5>
    <p>This library has been moved to the Processing core as of version 149. To load
    XML data, check out the reference for XMLElement in the extended reference.</p>

<p class="libraries-bottom">
Contributed libraries must be downloaded separately and placed within the "libraries" folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find the Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the Processing application and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top. Copy the contributed library's folder into the "libraries" folder at this location. <em>You will need to create the "libraries" folder if this is your first contributed library</em>. Follow the links below for more information about each library.<br />
<br />
Contributed libraries are developed, documented, and maintained by members of the Processing community. For feedback and support, please post to the <a href="http://processing.org/discourse">Discourse</a>, for development discussions post to <a href="http://processing.org/discourse/yabb_beta/YaBB.cgi?board=os_libraries_tools">Libraries, Tool Development</a>. Instructions for creating your own library are on the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/libraries/">Develop Processing</a> site.<br /><br />
Libraries that are not working with the current version of Processing appear below with light gray text. We're working with the library developers to encourage updates. Non-functioning libraries will be removed.
