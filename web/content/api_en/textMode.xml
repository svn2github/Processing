Sets the way text draws to the screen. In the default configuration, the MODEL mode, it's possible to rotate, scale, and place letters in two and three dimensional space. 
<br /><br />
The SHAPE mode draws text using the the glyph outlines of individual characters rather than as textures. This mode is only supported with the PDF and P3D renderer settings. With the PDF renderer, you must call <b>textMode(SHAPE)</b> before any other drawing occurs. If the outlines are not available, then <b>textMode(SHAPE)</b> will be ignored and <b>textMode(MODEL)</b> will be used instead.
<br /><br />
The <b>textMode(SHAPE)</b> option in P3D can be combined with <b>beginRaw()</b> to write vector-accurate text to 2D and 3D output files, for instance DXF or PDF. The SHAPE mode is not currently optimized for P3D, so if recording shape data, use <b>textMode(MODEL)</b> until you're ready to capture the geometry with <b>beginRaw()</b>.
