Sets the current normal vector. This is for drawing three dimensional shapes and surfaces and specifies a vector perpendicular to the surface of the shape which determines how lighting affects it. Processing attempts to automatically assign normals to shapes, but since that's imperfect, this is a better option when you want more control. This function is identical to glNormal3f() in OpenGL.
