Reads the contents of a file and places it in a byte array. If the name of the file is used as the parameter, as in the above example, the file must be loaded in the sketch's "data" directory/folder. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.<br />
<br />
If the file is not available or an error occurs, <b>null</b> will be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the null value may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned is null.<br/>
