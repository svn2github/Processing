Sets the current font that will be drawn with the <b>text()</b> function. Fonts must be loaded with <b>loadFont()</b> before it can be used. This font will be used in all subsequent calls to the <b>text()</b> function. If no <b>size</b> parameter is input, the font will appear at its original size (the size it was created at with the "Create Font..." tool) until it is changed with <b>textSize()</b>. <br /> <br /> Because fonts are usually bitmaped, you should create fonts at the sizes that will be used most commonly. Using <b>textFont()</b> without the size parameter will result in the cleanest-looking text. <br /><br /> With the default (JAVA2D) and PDF renderers, it's also possible to enable the use of native fonts via the command <b>hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS)</b>. This will produce vector text in JAVA2D sketches and PDF output in cases where the vector data is available: when the font is still installed, or the font is created via the <b>createFont()</b> function (rather than the Create Font tool).
