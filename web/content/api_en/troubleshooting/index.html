      I've found a bug!</h5>
	<p>
	<em>I know you're excited, but please avoid the urge to just email
      us!</em> especially sending mail to Ben or Casey directly. This
      includes sending us "Instant Messages" on the discourse section
      of the site. While you may prefer the privacy of a personal
      message, it's much quicker for
      you to write to the board, where you'll find all sorts of
      helpful people who are also often at all hours of the night. If you
      email us directly, we'll either not respond or just ask you to
      use the discourse board anyway.
<br /> <br />
<em>We spend a lot of
      our time helping people with Processing, so reading and
      following these instructions means that you respect our time and
      don't want to waste it.</em>
<br /> <br />
First, read the FAQ. Start with digging through this page and maybe
      the <A HREF="platforms.html">platforms</A> page too in case it's
      something specific to your operating system. 
<br /> <br />
Second, search the <a href="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/">bug
database</a> to see if your problem has already been reported. 
Most often, this will contain background on the bug, a workaround, 
or hopefully a bit about its status. The bug database is unfortunately
      incomplete so it doesn't cover everything, but it will get
      better with time.

<br /> <br />
If you don't find your bug, enter it as a new bug in
the database, which we use to keep track of things. If you're having
      trouble or find it confusing (or the word "database" gives you
      the willies), please post on the
      discourse board so that we can get you straightened out.
<br /> <br />
When reporting please include information about
<OL>
<LI> the revision number (i.e. 0085)</LI>
<LI> what operating system you're using, and on what kind of hardware
<LI> a copy of the smallest possible piece of code that will
   produce the error you're having trouble with</LI>
<LI> details of the error, either the red spew that you see in the
console, or the last few lines from the files stdout.txt or stderr.txt 
from the 'lib' folder. </LI>
</OL>

For stranger errors during compile time, you can also look inside the
build folder which contains an intermediate (translated into
java) version of your code. The build folder is in the same location
as preferences.txt: <br />

<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; build</LI>
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; </LI>

Processing &rarr; build
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; build</LI>
</UL>
The more details you can post, the better, because it helps us figure
out what's going on. Useful things when reporting:
<UL>
<LI> We want the minimum amount of code that will still replicate the
  bug. The worst that can happen is we get a report with a subject
  saying "problem!" along with a three page program. 
  Sure, everyone likes a puzzle, but simpler code will receive a 
  faster response. </LI>
<LI> Occasionally we may need you to pack up a copy of your sketch folder 
  or something similar so that we can try and replicate the weirdness 
  on our own machine. Rest assured, we have no interest in messing with
  your fancy creations or stealing your ideas. The Processing team is
  a pair of straight-laced boys who hail from the midwestern U.S. who 
  were brought up better than that. and as we often lack enough time to
  build our own projects, we have even less time to spend figuring out
  other peoples' projects to rip them off.</LI>

      Processing won't start! Nothing happens when I click &ldquo;Run&rdquo;!</h5>
	<p>
Windows
<UL>
<LI>If you're using the "without Java" download, try downloading the version that includes Java. Chances are, your machine has Java 1.5 installed, which is <A HREF="platforms#java">not supported</A> and causes lots of headaches. For instance, it won't play nice with some graphics cards and causes the Processing window to come up mostly blank.
<LI> Processing seems to have trouble starting when run from a user 
account that contains non-ascii characters. For instance, if your name 
contains Japanese characters or umlauts, it's likely to have trouble. 
Sometimes using run.bat instead will fix this. Another fix is to
create a user account that uses only ascii characters. In the meantime, 
we're looking for a fix. (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=49">Bug 49</A>)

<LI>If you have lots of garbage in your CLASSPATH environment
  variable, that might cause trouble starting up a sketch. You might
  get "Couldn't find package xxx.xxx" errors. Clean things up by avoiding
  spaces and quotes. This is because of Windows' awesome
  hokiness and its not-as-distant-as-it-should-be ancestor DOS. In the
  future, we'd like to detect errors like this before they cause
  trouble. That issue is being tracked at <A
  HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=112">Bug 112</A>.
<LI>You might also try using run.bat to start processing. Lots
  of people seem to have a better time with this method.
<LI>Some graphics cards have conflicts with Java applications and
therefore Processing, which can cause the application to hang or
freeze. Under one scenario, disabling anti-aliasing on the card will
get rid of these problems (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=232">Bug 232</A>).

<LI>If you're still having trouble, try disabling any overly
  protective virus scanning software. It might be holding things up,
  especially when libraries have been imported.
</UL>
Mac OS X
<UL>
<LI>First be sure that you're not trying to run Processing from the disk image. As with most programs, Processing needs to be copied to the Applications folder in order for it to run properly.
<LI>If it's still not working, open Console.app, found in Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Console and see if there are any messages. If you don't know what they mean, post them to the discourse board where someone can help you out.
<LI>Using developer releases of Java is strongly discouraged. These can often cause problems and we can't possibly support them.
<LI>If you're running on Mac OS X 10.2, read the <a href="platforms.html#mac">platforms</a> section regarding things that may be broken.
<LI>Sometimes you might see the following error: <br />

<TT>dyld: /Applications/processing/jikes version mismatch for library:<br />/sw/lib/libiconv.2.dylib (compatibility version of user: <br />
5.0.0 greater than library's version: 3.0.0)</TT> <br />
It seems that this happens when an older version of <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</A> is installed. In this case, you should either update or uninstall Fink. (thanks to Ryan Govostes for tracking this down)
</UL>
Linux
<UL>
<LI>If you get an error reading <TT>jikes: error while loading 
shared libraries: libstdc++.so.5: cannot open shared object file: 
No such file or directory</TT>,
It's because Processing requires libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3 for jikes. 
You should either install it or, since it's old, install the rpm/package 
for compat-libstdc++ before Processing will run. Or find/rebuild a different 
version of jikes that's compatible with your distro. Jikes is available 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128803">here</a>, and it's an easy ./configure, make, and then copy src/jikes to the 
processing-XXXX folder and you should be all set. (<A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47">Bug 47</A>)

<br /> <br />
<LI>Or if you encounter a problem like this one: <TT>jikes: relocation
error: /opt/processing-0087/./jikes: undefined symbol:
__dynamic_cast_2</TT>, then that also means that jikes is incompatible
with your distro. (Also <A
HREF="http://as.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=47">Bug 47</A>)
</UL>
Any Platform
<UL>
<LI> 
Errors inside code that is outside of setup() or draw() may just
hang/freeze Processing. For instance, with this code, if "blah.vlw" is
not in the "data" folder, it may just hang:
<PRE>  PFont font = loadFont("blah.vlw");

  void setup {
    // your awesome code
  }</PRE>
In general, a better practice is to use loadFont() (and
loadImage and the rest) inside of a function like setup().

      This used to work and now it doesn't</h5>
	<p>Read the <a href="../changes.html">changes</A> section of the reference.</p>
	
	<h5 id="applet"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Export and Browser Troubles</h5>
	<p>
Sketches (applets) often have trouble once exported that will cause
errors in a browser. <br /> <br />

To figure out what your problem is, you should first check the Java
(not JavaScript!) console. On Windows, right-click the coffee cup at
the right of the task bar, and select "Open Console". On Mac OS X, go
to Applications &rarr; Utilities &rarr; Console.app and see what the last
few error messages were.
<br /> <br />
The most common cause is a security issue. For details on how to avoid
this, see <A HREF="export.html#signing">this section</A> of the FAQ. 
Java applets aren't allowed to do things like the following:
<UL>
<LI>Applets cannot open or write to files on the local machine. So
things like saveFrame() will cause an error when run from an
applet. To read files, make sure that you use "Add File..." to add the
file to your sketch (or place it in the data folder yourself) so that
it will be included when exported. Then, only use functions like
loadStrings(), loadImage(), openStream(), etc. to read data from your file.
<LI>Applets may not connect to servers other than the one from which
they came. If you need to redirect things from another server, you can
write a short script that will do it, understanding the possible
security consequences for your own machine.
<LI>Applets are also not allowed to do things like capture video or
audio. You don't want a malicious applet that turns on your webcam and
starts sending things back to their server.
<LI>
</UL>

Other issues:
<UL>
<LI>Another common problem is placing images or files into the sketch
folder by hand, rather than placing them in the data folder (or using
"Add File..." to do so automatically). This will work from the
PDE, but on export, the files won't be in included with your sketch
because they're not in the data folder.
<LI>Watch out for issues with capitalization! Windows and Mac OS don't
care about capitalization, so "blah.JPG" looks just the same as
"blah.jpg". However, since most servers run on Unix, capitalization
becomes a huge problem, because it must be exact. We've added some
checks to try and catch this (at least for images) but they're not
perfect. This can especially be a problem when the .JPG extension is
not even visible (the default on Windows), so you don't know whether
it's upper or lower case.
<LI> If you get a "ClassCastException" when trying to run your code 
  in a browser, you're probably trying to run non-Java 1.1 compliant 
  code. This means any classes that didn't exist in java 1.1. Or, 
  if if you're exporting as applet, variables that are 'final int' 
  need to be 'static final int', otherwise they'll have trouble on 
  a maching that only has Java 1.1 installed (i.e. running Microsoft's 
  Java on Windows). You should also avoid using "final" variables 
  <em>inside</em> of methods, since those aren't supported by 
  Microsoft's VM (and that's the one most widely installed).
<LI>Your browser may be using an old version of an
applet. Unfortunately it's often difficult to get your browser to
flush its cache. You
may need to quit all instances of the browser, use alt-reload (or ctrl
or shift or option, who knows) to get the new version to show
up. On Windows, clicking the Java coffee cup at the right of the task
bar can bring up a control panel that will let you flush the Java
cache too. This is different across all platforms, but if someone
wants to write a good explanation for any platform they're familiar
with, please post on the <A
HREF="http://processing.org/discourse/">discourse</A> area of the site
and we'll add it to the FAQ.
</UL>
Some libraries simply don't work with the web (at least not for now):
<UL>
<LI><strike>You cannot use the OpenGL library from the web. </STRIKE>(<A HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=166">Bug 166</A>) As of revision 0113, it's possible for applets that use the OPENGL renderer setting to run from the web.

<LI><STRIKE>The video library (both Capture and Movie) cannot be used on the
web</STRIKE> As of release 0115, it's possible to play back movies via the web,
however you still cannot capture video without a signed applet (see above).

      Out Of Memory Errors</h5>
	<p>
If you get an OutOfMemoryError while running your program, use the
Preferences window to increase the amount of available memory.
<br /> <br />
Depending on your OS and available RAM, there are limits on how much
memory you can ask for. Use this preference with caution, 
because if you set the memory too high, 
programs will no longer run in Processing. 
When you hit run, you'll get error messages. <br /> <br />

This message means that you're trying to use more memory than the 
machine has installed:
<PRE>

Error occurred during initialization of VM
Could not reserve enough space for object heap

</PRE>

These mean that you're trying to use more memory than the
Operating System allows (regardless of how much RAM you have):

<PRE>

Invalid maximum heap size: -Xmx5000m
Could not create the Java virtual machine.

Invalid maximum heap size: -Xmx5g
The specified size exceeds the maximum representable size.
Could not create the Java virtual machine.

</PRE>

On Windows with 1G of RAM, it seems to be in
the neighborhood of 1.5 GB. Mac OS X and Linux seem to allow up to 
just shy of 4 GB, depending on how much RAM you have installed. 
Usually you can allocate 50% more RAM than you have installed. 
i.e. for a machine with 1 GB of physical memory, about 1.5 GB is
the maximum that can be used. Your mileage will also vary with 
different versions of Java (1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6...)
<br /> <br />
Unfortunately the memory limitations of Java set an upper bound 
that is outside our control. If you're having trouble creating very 
large images for this reason, you might look into the PDF or DXF 
libraries that are included with Processing, or the contributed 
Illustrator or SVG vector export libraries that can be found on the 
libraries page as another alternative for creating large format images.
<br /> <br />
There are also two known bugs that eat memory:
<UL>
<LI>OpenGL is really memory hungry because of how textures work.
<LI>
</UL>

<!--
There are two types of programs in Processing. Some are run from
inside the environment, but whenever you import a library, include a
code folder, or use "Present" to view your sketch, it will be run
as a separate Java program, which we sometimes call running "externally".
<br /> <br />
To increase the amount of memory available to those programs, open
your preferences.txt file and edit the run.options line to include
something like:
<PRE>-Xms128m -Xmx1024m</PRE>
This will increase the amount of RAM to 128 megabytes of stack, and
1024 megabytes of heap (the latter being effectively usable RAM).
This will eventually be a setting that's added to the preferences
window (<A
HREF="http://dev.processing.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=233">Bug 233</A>).
<br /> <br />
Depending on your OS and available RAM, there are limits on how much
memory you can ask for. On Windows with 1G of RAM, it seems to be in
the neighborhood of 1.5 GB. Mac OS X seems to be somewhat similar, but
you mileage will vary with different versions of Java (1.3, 1.4,
1.5). Unfortunately this does place an upper bound on things that is
outside our control. You might look into the contributed Illustrator
or SVG vector export libraries that can be found on the libraries page
as another alternative for creating large format images.
<br /> <br />
The preferences.txt file is stored in different locations on each
platform:
<UL>
<LI> Windows: Documents and Settings &rarr; (your user name) &rarr;
Application Data &rarr; Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Mac OS X: Users &rarr; (your user name) &rarr; Library &rarr; 
Processing &rarr; preferences.txt
<LI> Linux and others: ~/.processing &rarr; preferences.txt
</UL>
To increase the amount of memory for Processing itself and for
sketches that are not running externally: 
<UL>
<LI>On Windows, try adjusting the parameters in the file 'run.bat' and
use that to run instead of Processing.exe. Short instructions can be
found inside that file. It appears that the maximum amount of RAM that
can be used on Windows is around 1.4 GB.
<br /> <br />
<LI>On Mac OS X, right-click on Processing, select Show Package
Contents, then edit "Info.plist" inside "Contents". Change these
lines:
<PRE>&lt;key&gt;VMOptions&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;-Xms128M -Xmx256M&lt;/string&gt;</PRE>
to set to something higher than 128M and 256M (128 and 256 megabytes
of ram) as you need to (and at your own risk).
<br /> <br />
<LI>On Linux, adjust the Processing shell script as needed.
</UL>

	<h5 id="strings"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Why don't these Strings equal?</h5>
	<p>
Comparing a string (quoted text) is different in Processing (Java) than it is in
ActionScript, which often confuses people. For instance, while this
might make sense:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (lines[i] == "hello") { 
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // you'll never see this
  }
}</PRE>
You'll never see the message, even if "hello" is in the list. 
This is because a String is an <em>object</em>
in Java, comparing them with == will only compare whether the two
things are pointing at the same memory, not their actual
contents. Instead, use equals() or one of the other String methods:
<PRE>String[] lines = loadStrings("sometext.txt");
for (int i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  if (<B>lines[i].equals("hello")</B>) {
    println("hello found on line: " + i); // happiness
  }
}</PRE>
      </p>
	
	<h5 id="integers"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up_arrow.gif" width="26" height="19" alt="Top" /></a> 
      Why does 2 / 5 = 0 instead of 0.4?</h5>
	<p>
The result of dividing two integers will always be another integer:
<PRE>int a = 2;
int b = 5;
int result = a / b;
// result is zero</PRE>
While somewhat confusing at first, this is later useful for more
advanced programming. <br /> <br />

To get fractions, use a 'float' instead: 
<PRE>float a = 2.0;
float b = 5.0;
float result = a / b;
// result is 0.4</PRE>
It is not enough to just divide two integers and set them to a float:
<PRE>float y = 2 / 5;</PRE>
In this case, integer 2 is divided by 5, which is zero, and then zero
is assigned to a float. The number doesn't become a float until the
lefthand side of the = sign. On the other hand, this:
<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5;</PRE>
will work just fine. In this case, Java sees that 2.0 is a float, so
it also converts the 5 to a float so that they can be divided, which
makes it identical to:
<PRE>float y = 2.0 / 5.0;</PRE>
and because floats are being used on the righthand side, the result
will be a float, even before it gets to the lefthand side.
