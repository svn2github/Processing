<description><![CDATA[
Writes an array of Strings to a file, one line per String. This file is saved to the sketch's folder, which is opened by selecting "Show Sketch Folder" from the "Sketch" menu.<br />

Starting with Processing 1.0, all files loaded and saved by the Processing API use UTF-8 encoding. In earlier releases, the default encoding for your platform was used, which causes problems when files are moved to other platforms.
