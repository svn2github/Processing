  <h2>SVG</h2>
    
<p>Candy is a minimal SVG import library for Processing.
Candy was written by Michael Chang, and later revised and  
expanded for use as a Processing core library by Ben Fry.
</p>
<p>
SVG stands for Scalar Vector Graphics, a portable graphics
format. It is a vector format so it allows for infinite resolution
and relatively minute file sizes. Most modern media software
can view SVG files, including Firefox, Adobe products, etc. 
You can use something like Illustrator to edit SVG files.
</p>
<p>
We have no intention of turning this into a full-featured SVG library.
The goal of this project is a basic shape importer that is small enough
to be included with applets, meaning that its download size should be 
in the neighborhood of 25-30k. Because of this size, it is not made part
of processing.core, because it would increase the download size of any
applet by 20%, and it's not a feature that will be used by 20% of our 
audience. For more sophisticated import/export, consider the 
<A HREF="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/">Batik</A> library
from the Apache Software Foundation. Future improvements to this
library may focus on this properly supporting a specific subset of
SVG, for instance the simpler SVG profiles known as 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile/">SVG Tiny or Basic</A>, 
although we still would not support the interactivity options.
</p>
<p>
This library was specifically tested under SVG files created from
Adobe Illustrator. I can't guarantee that it'll work for any
SVG's created from anything else. In the future I will also
test with open source graphics editing software so we'll reach
maximal compatibility. In the mean time, you're on your own.
</p>
<p>
An SVG created under Illustrator must be created in one of two ways:
<UL>
<LI>File &rarr; Save for Web (or control-alt-shift-s on a PC). Under 
settings, make sure the CSS properties is set to "Presentation Attributes". 
<LI>With Illustrator CS2, it is also possible to use "Save As" with "SVG" 
as the file setting, but the CSS properties should also be set similarly.
</UL> 
Saving it any other way will most likely break Candy.
