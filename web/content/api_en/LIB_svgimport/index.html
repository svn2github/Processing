  <h2>Candy (SVG Import)</h2>
    
<p>Candy is a minimal SVG import library for Processing.
Candy was written by Michael Chang, and later revised and  
expanded for use as a Processing core library by Ben Fry.
</p>
<p>
SVG stands for Scalar Vector Graphics, a portable graphics
format. It is a vector format so it allows for infinite resolution
and relatively minute file sizes. Most modern media software
can view SVG files, including Firefox, Adobe products, etc. 
You can use something like Illustrator to edit SVG files.
</p>
<p>
This library was specifically tested under SVG files created from
Adobe Illustrator. I can't guarantee that it'll work for any
SVG's created from anything else. In the future I will also
test with open source graphics editing software so we'll reach
maximal compatibility. In the mean time, you're on your own.
</p>
<p>
An SVG created under Illustrator must be created in one of two ways:
<UL>
<LI>File &rarr; Save for Web (or control-alt-shift-s on a PC). Under 
settings, make sure the CSS properties is set to "Presentation Attributes". 
<LI>With Illustrator CS2, it is also possible to use "Save As" with "SVG" 
as the file setting, but the CSS properties should also be set similarly.
</UL> 
Saving it any other way will most likely break Candy.
