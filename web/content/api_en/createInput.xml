<description>
Simplified method to open a Java InputStream. This method is useful if you want to use the facilities provided by PApplet to easily open things from the data folder or from a URL, but want an InputStream object so that you can use other Java methods to take more control of how the stream is read.
<br /><br />
If the requested item doesn't exist, null is returned. (Prior to Processing version 0096, <b>die()</b> would be called, killing the applet.) For 0096+, the "data" folder is exported intact with subfolders, and <b>openStream()</b> properly handles subdirectories from the data folder. 
<br /><br />
If not online, this will also check to see if the user is asking for a file whose name isn't properly capitalized. This helps prevent issues when a sketch is exported to the web, where case sensitivity matters, as opposed to Windows and the Mac OS default where case sensitivity is preserved but ignored.
<br /><br />
The filename passed in can be:<br />
- A URL, for instance openStream("http://processing.org/");<br />
- A file in the sketch's data folder<br />
- Another file to be opened locally (when running as an application)
<br /><br />
A related function called <b>createInputRaw()</b> does the same thing, but without automatic gzip decompression.
