Currently JavaScript mode does not support .plw font files and will just call <a href="createFont_.html">createFont()</a> instead.

Loads a font into a variable of type <b>PFont</b>. To load correctly, fonts must be located in the data directory of the current sketch. To create a font to use with Processing, select "Create Font..." from the Tools menu. This will create a font in the format Processing requires and also adds it to the current sketch's data directory. Like <b>loadImage()</b> and other functions that load data, the <b>loadFont()</b> function should not be used inside <b>draw()</b>, because it will slow down the sketch considerably, as the font will be re-loaded from the disk (or network) on each frame.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, the file maybe be loaded from anywhere on the local computer using an absolute path (something that starts with / on Unix and Linux, or a drive letter on Windows), or the filename parameter can be a URL for a file found on a network.<br />
<br />
If the file is not available or an error occurs, <b>null</b> will be returned and an error message will be printed to the console. The error message does not halt the program, however the null value may cause a NullPointerException if your code does not check whether the value returned is null.<br/>
<br />
For most renderers, Processing displays fonts using the .vlw font format, which uses images for each letter, rather than defining them through vector data. When <b>hint(ENABLE_NATIVE_FONTS)</b> is used with the default renderer, the native version of a font will be used if it is installed on the user's machine.<br /> 
<br />
Using <b>createFont()</b> (instead of loadFont) enables vector data to be used with the default renderer setting. This can be helpful when many font sizes are needed, or when using any renderer based on the default renderer, such as the PDF library.
