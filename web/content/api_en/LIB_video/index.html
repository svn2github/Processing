    <p>The video library allows Processing to display QuickTime video 
    files and grab video data from a camera. Video can be captured from 
    USB Cameras, IEEE 1394 Cameras, or Video Cards with composite or S-video 
    input devices connected to the computer. Video can be loaded from 
    QuickTime files located on your computer or anywhere on the Internet.</p> 
    
    <p>For this library to work, it is necessary to have QuickTime for Java 
    installed on your computer. Download and install QuickTime and do 
    a custom installation, making sure the <em>QuickTime for Java</em> option 
    is selected.</p>
    
    <p>You also need video driver software for translating from the proprietary 
    format of your video source into commonly used video functions. You 
    can get this software from the makers of the video hardware.</p>
    
    <p>If you are not using an Apple computer, you will also need a VDIG, 
    a video driver that translates from your hardware to the video functions 
    used by QuickTime. This software may be included in the software provided 
    by the maker of your hardware, or you can download the free VDIG available 
    at http://www.vdig.com and check if it is compatible with your video 
    camera. The free VDIG is slower than many you pay for.</p>

    <h5>Capture</h5>
    <p>The Capture class makes it possible to grab frames of video from an attached 
        capture device such as a camera. Adjustments to the size and speed are 
        made through calling the functions defined below.<br />
