    <h2>DXF</h2>
    
  <p>This library writes all current triangle-based graphics (polygons, boxes, 
    spheres, etc.) to a DXF file. It works with the beginRaw() and endRaw() functions. 
    Use something like a keyPressed() to trigger it, to avoid writing a file each 
    time through draw(). Usually, the file will be saved to the sketch's folder. 
    Use Sketch &gt; Show Sketch Folder to see it from the Processing Environment.</p>
  <p>A simple example of how to use: </p>
  <pre>import processing.dxf.*;

boolean record;

void setup() {
  size(500, 500, P3D);
}

void keyPressed() {
  // use a key press so that it doesn't make a million files
  if (key == 'r') record = true;
}

void draw() {
  if (record) {
    beginRaw("processing.dxf.RawDXF", "output.dxf");
  }

  // do all your drawing here

  if (record) {
    endRaw();
    record = false;
  }
}</pre>
