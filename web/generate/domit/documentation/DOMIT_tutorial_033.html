						<p>One of PHPs most glaring weaknesses is poor support for various character sets.
						As long as a string is ASCII text, no problems occur. However, there is no simple and transparent way,
						using the standard PHP string functions, to properly handle multi-byte encodings such as the BIG5 encoding
						used for the Chinese language.
						</p>
						
						<p>This is a problem especially for XML parsers like <b>DOMIT!</b>, since according to the XML specification
						they are required to be unicode compliant.</p>
						
						<p>One way of resolving this is using the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php" target="_child">mb_string extension</a>.
						This will in the near future be integrated with <b>DOMIT!</b>,
						but the one disadvantage of such an approach is that mb_string must be installed separately from the base
						PHP distribution, which may not be possible with some web hosting providers.</p>
						
						<p>The <span class="code">loadXML_utf8</span>, <span class="code">parseXML_utf8</span>,
						and <span class="code">saveXML_utf8</span> methods were originally intended to get around some of these
						problems, but they have not proved to be very effective and are currently <i>not recommended for use</i>.</p>
						
						<p>A partial, though imperfect, solution to multibyte encodings has been introduced as of <b>DOMIT! 0.95</b>.
						This is the <span class="code">appendEntityTranslationTable</span> method.</p>
						
						<p>The <span class="code">appendEntityTranslationTable</span> method allows you to encode non-ASCII characters as
						XML entities in your xml document, and provide a translation table at parse time to convert these entities into
						their equivalent characters. It assumes that the document being loaded has all non-ASCII characters converted into entities.</p>
						
						<p>For example, the following code provides an (abridged) entity translation table for accented French characters:</p>
						

						
						
						<p><pre class="code">
$xmldoc =&amp; new DOMIT_Document();
$xmldoc-&gt;appendEntityTranslationTable(array('&amp;#233;' => 'é'));
$xmldoc-&gt;loadXML('francais.xml', true);
</pre></p>

						<p>When the document is saved using the <span class="code">saveXML</span> method, all characters in the translation table are automatically
						converted back into entities.</p>
