		<p>Processing was started in Fall 2001 by Ben 
        Fry and Casey Reas. Fry was a PhD candidate at the MIT Media Laboratory 
        and Reas was an Associate Professor at the Interaction Design Institute 
        Ivrea. While Fry and Reas were employees of these institutions, Processing 
        began as a personal initiative and development took place during the night 
        and weekends through 2003. MIT indirectly funded Processing through Fry's 
        graduate stipend and Ivrea indirectly funded Processing through Reas's 
        salary. Due to his research agreement with MIT, all code written by Fry 
        during this time is copyright MIT.</p>

        <p>In summer 2003, Ivrea funded four individuals to work on the project for 
        a few months. This resulted in Dan Mosedale's preprocessor using Antlr 
        and Sami Arola's contributions to the graphics engine. The code for these 
        elements are both copyright 2003 Interaction Design Institute Ivrea.</p>

        <p>In August 2003, Reas left the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea and in 
        June 2004, Fry left the MIT Media Laboratory. The code and complete reference 
        written since June 2004 are copyright Ben Fry and Casey Reas.</p>

        <p>Portions of the code were written by other contributors and are attributed 
        in the source code. For example, portions of the graphics engine were 
        written by Karsten Schmidt. There are many contributions to the Exhibition 
        and Examples on the Processing.org website and these are attributed in 
        context.</p>
