<h1><img src="/img/learning/header-3d.gif" alt="3D Examples. By changing the renderer to P3D or OPENGL, it's possible to draw in 3D and control the lighting and camera." /></h1>

These examples add the third parameter "P3D" to <strong>size()</strong> to draw in 3D. All of these examples can also run faster by importing the OpenGL library from the "Import Library" menu and using the constant OPENGL as the third parameter to <strong>size()</strong>.
