    <div class="intro">
        <p>Processing is an open source programming language and environment for 
        people who want to program images, animation, and interactions. It is used by 
        students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists for 
        learning, prototyping, and production. It is created to teach fundamentals 
        of computer programming within a visual context and to serve as a software 
        sketchbook and professional production tool.</p>
        
        <p>Processing is free to <a href="/download/">download</a> and available 
        for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. To contribute to the project's development, please visit 
		<a href="http://code.google.com/p/processing/">Processing on Google Code</a>, which includes 
		bug tracking and instructions for building the code, downloading the source, and 
		creating libraries and tools.</p>
        
        <p>Processing is an open project initiated by <a href="http://benfry.com">Ben 
		Fry</a> and <a href="http://reas.com">Casey Reas</a>. It evolved from ideas explored 
		in the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab.</p>
