iprocessing todo list // last updated 16 october 2001
(most up-to-date version of this file is in processing cvs)


PEOPLE WHO WANT IT
_ christophe buffet <christophe@wkmx.org>


changes to graphics
_ rect now uses x, y, width, height instead of x1, y1, x2, y2
_ circle has been replaced with ellipse
_ box takes width, height, depth instead of six coordinates


for 0010
X make acu fonts work again
X write code to use simple bitmap fonts
_ docs
_   explain using inner classes and using non-public classes
_   start 'errors' section
_     NullPointerException inside setup usually means no size()
_   ability to write functions and inner classes
_   mention ability to use import statements in java mode
_     ability to do real (but not public) classes in same document
_   make note in documentation about getting access to pixel array
_     check to see if get/set functions in applet actually work
_     fix documentation appropriately
_   documentation says 'mouseDown' even though it's 'mousePressed'
X strangeness with stroke when a rect goes off outside the window
_ fix color cube applet 
_   make it run in current version of processing
_   fix background from showing up black
X redone random functions in processing applet
_   update documentation on web page
_ crappy way of determining if inside a class--ignores comments
_ option to enable/disable frame on running applets
_ compiling .java files leaves the .class files next to the .java
_   make sure all the dirs in sketchbook added to classpath on startup
_   if new dir added, must restart processing (this is acceptable)
_ ability to include other code from sketchbook directory
_   compile entire sketchbook on startup, then check for new files on compile?
X   kjc not smart enough to just compile things that are in classpath
_ when applet window is too large to fit, center and put in back
_ notes about running on win98 and that stupid startup exception
X add a file with bugs for testing
_ fix bugs from the 'bugs' file 
_ if BagelImage doesn't load, then image() calls arrayindexoutofbounds
_   better solution for this (error while opening image)
_   and document how image loading works


for 0011
_ run java code besides processing applets 
_   if not processing applet, look for a main(), no main give an error
_ give warning when compiling w/o kjcprocessingapplet
_ stop required before kill for applets that use serial
_   this is behaving strangely
_ new objects draw behind old objects with noBackground()
_ breaks on every 2nd run when using serial apps (or others?)
_   try calling gc on stop as well
_ post new macintosh version
_   with serial port support


PROCESSING - HIGH
_ make images work again
_ write code to bind with java fonts
_ bug in paren balancing
_ shift-click on play for 'presentation mode'
_   does full screen and hides editor window
_ export doesn't work properly for stuff included from scrapbook
_ write dist.bat for releases
_   don't forget to update 'export' dir with processing releases
_ what happens if size() not called inside setup() ?
_ when using draw() instead of loop()
_   applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_ multiple types of KjcEngine (so that simplest model is available)
_ write code for automatic macintosh releases
_ make note of functions/variables used by ProcessingApplet
_   using them in your app will break things (i.e. init())


PROCESSING - MEDIUM
_ comprehensive list of reserved keywords
_ better handling on portinuse exception
_   or general exception handling--could go through some interface
_ compile from the sketchbook if there are changes
_ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
_   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
_ curves not properly implemented as part of shape architecture 
_ lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
_ kill button (without stop) doesn't clear play
_ image grabbing code (write to tiff)
_ build a linux/x86 release
_ per-vertex shading doesn't work
_ the lights prolly shouldn't follow objects around
_ work on courseware applet code signing
_ why is z going negative, seems weird
_   maybe view needs to go from -100 to 100 with zero at screen plane
_ code to save a project to the main machine
_   setting up 'project' directories
_ delayUntil would be nice to have
_   but at some point there has to be a cutoff
_   have a library of useful code that people can add to programs
_   otherwise things are too simple, and env is a crutch
_ courseware menu
_   list of 'people' and 'projects'; refresh 
_   based on local dir named 'projects' or 'sketchbook'?
_ copyPixel(x, y, to_x, to_y)
_ copyArea(x, y, w, h, to_x, to_y)
_ copyImage(image, x, y, w, h,  to_x, to_y)
_ lesson plans (easier to translate)
_ write example applets in processing
_ courseware system 
_   uploading pieces when finished - scrapbook/sketchbook model?
_   download new versions of pde.jar from main machine
_ some kind of text
_ quicktime exporter or image sequence export
_ nice to have a random number generator between -1..1 
_   as well as an integer random; instead of just 0..1
_ show creas how to get access to cvs
_ how to use ssh identity file to maintain auth for brancusi


BAGEL
X got rid of colorscale and using colormode for all instead
_   make changes in documentation
X 'ellipse' instead of 'oval'?
_   make note in documentation
X catmullrom is broken 
_   write documentation for new curve functions

_ where do the 'error line is 9' messages come from?
_   these are runtime errors inside bagel code, how to trap?
_ get web documentation back into cvs
_ have to get rid of static i/o stuff before porting to c
_   may also need to get rid of floating point constants
_ current acu fonts are broken
_ area copying function: copy(x1, y1, w, h,  xto, yto);

_ should math functions be moved in?
_   this could help porting, and sanity in processingapplet
_   io functions might be treated similarly

_ loadImage/loadFont or getImage/getFont?
_ text(char c), text(string s)
_ image() and 2D/2D affine versions of it
_ min() seems funny/unavailable
_ some method of moving between 
_   center oriented: x, y, radius (3D style)
_   and 2D style: x1, y1, x2, y2
_   or x, y, diameter
_ make note in docs about removal of LINE from LINES
_ build in second matrix type: 2d affine
_ add convex polygon type
_ make note in documentation about convex polygons

_ sketch in antialiasing functions
_ how does color depth work on ipaq? 4-4-4? 5-6-5?

_ font usage/substition solution
_   java freetype? jni freetype to build texmap fonts?
_   look at flash file format? (does it have kerning?)

_ screen grabbing code
_ simpler bitmap fonts w/o smoothing, just 2D
_ alpha blending (easier)
_ antialiasing
_ setting origins
_   should shapes draw from center or from upper left?
_   should ovals use radius or diameter?
_   should shapes use x1, y1 - x2, y2 or x, y, w, h?


BAGEL - SHOULD
_ bresenham (flat) oval function
_ setting accuracy of circles/sphere
_ setting accuracy of curve segments
_ write shearing function
_ optimize rotation functions
_ test winding polygons in different directions
_ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
_ non-homogenous colors for beginShape()
_   currently disabled b/c homogenousColors not set false for vertices
_   and code not written for curve vertices
_ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
_ when stroke in use, stroke letters (currently stroke doesn't affect


BUG WATCH 
_ getMillis() returning 0 in some instances/on some machines


PROCESSING - FEATURES
_ run code with a main() that's not a processing applet
_ want emacs-style editor that's faster loading than emacs
_ regexps: http://javaregex.com/cgi-bin/pat/tutorial.asp
_ a better editor: 
_   syntax coloring
_   emacs indents and key commands
_   http://mathsrv.ku-eichstaett.de/MGF/homes/grothmann/je/index.html


PROCESSING - LOWER
_ tweak updater a little bit so it's more likely to work
_   use numbered versioning? 
_   give updater feedback (progress dialog, error msg)
_ move math functions into utility library associated
_   with bagel, because those will be useful on other bagel platforms
_ perlin noise function
_ make some kind of internal color picker
_   could be a separate window that's always around if needed
_ save window x, y, width, height to pde.properties on exit
_ bagelpublic.pl: open ProcessingApplet, rewrite after special token
_ look at glut for other needed shapes
_ make PdeEditorButtons wait until mouseup to change
_   (currently doesn't feel as good as it could)
_ licensing issues with kjc (before public release)


ENV
_ env. toggle for showing a function name each time its hit
_ env. toggle for showing line numbers within a function
_   i'm here messages, tie in with breakpoints for debugger
_   lightweight debugger, doesn't slow down, runs in back
_ env. toggle to show attr/value for some var in simple way
_ comments as debugging descriptors, output to console, shown in context
_ comments as naming for shapes drawn after it,
_   or some other model of naming based on inserted text with "" or // or #
_   could fit nicely with printf-style statements and comments
_   comments would contain descriptions //!blah for printing and formatting
_ sketchbook - doodling/scribbling area.. since wacom tablet easily accessible


---------------------------------------------


// ability to write data other than image into the buffer
// pixels won't go away, embrace pixels in sophisticated way
// lists of names of objects, or the 'line number' buffer
// maybe user can introduce new kinds of buffers at will (!!!)

// better 3D for valence/illustrator output:
//   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
//   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
//     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl

// drawLine vs moveto, lineto
// less of a deal, until fillpath, since that needs to store the
// last several points. but maybe if it's inside a begin/end
// then it's no big deal, and it's easy to implement

// when casting to an int, should 0.5f be added first

// functions that take 2d arguments are drawn on the
// z = 0 plane, and not affected by current 3D transform matrix


---------------------------------------------

code tidbit:


String binary(int value) {
  return "" + (((value & (1 << 7)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 6)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 5)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 4)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 3)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 2)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 1)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 0)) == 0) ? '0' : '1');
}
