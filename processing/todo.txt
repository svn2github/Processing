QUESTIONS
_ is day, month, year overkill inside processingapplet?
_ PImage, PFont or how to name?
_ loadImage or getImage?
_ bezierVertex/catmullRomVertex poorly named (based on algo used)
_   instead curveVertex/fitCurveVertex/etc.
_ circle/square functions
_ should the default be 100x100
_ maybe stop/kill button should only be a stop btn


RANDOM UNSORTED MESS
_ add method for exporting applications with processing
_   wrapper that invokes the applet using a copy of the jre
_ move MemoryImageSource out of bagel and into ProcessingApplet
_   need to be able to run bagel to just render to a large internal buffer
_ version of ProcessingApplet that replaces g. with ai. or pdf.
_ it's very unstable, previous versions such as 7 were solid. 
_   problems come with moving (what's that mean?)
_ fixed width fonts
_   document fixed width font format as technote
_   write code for reading uncompressed b/w tiff images
_ maybe turn the external applet stuff off again
_ garbage created when color values out of range
_ exporting to applet/.jar file
_   include other .class files built besides the main one
_   include referenced image and font files (can't do if numbered)
_ debugging serial code
_   hyperterminal - watching for binary garbage vs ascii text
_   first debug (maybe even using ascii) and watch in hyperterminal
_     or ship pooterm along with processing
_   flicker - often ascii instead of binary
_   timing of sleep, size of message, timing of write
_   starting processing first, then stamp
_ serial.messageReceived extra long crap in demo.pde
_ NullPointerException on startup in pde editor buttons
_ exporting applets that have custom name problems:
_   if extends processingapplet, the name user types must be same
_   gets confused about paths and puts boogers in weird places
_   doesn't compile correctly (must first compile with play)
_   doesn't include additional (private) classes
_ technote: using transformPoint
_ technote: using curves
_ technote: making things faster
_   noBackground() if you're covering everything
_ class unloading not happening
_   when doing an extends ProcessingApplet
_   need to add randomizer to even non-self gen'd classes
_   or figure out how to unload old classes.. grr
_ include stdout/stderr in the processing window
_   option to toggle window on/off (not just in properties, but realtime)
_   set # of lines in properties
_ remove .java and .class files for compiled classes
_ technote about bug in sun vm for freaking out
_ technote about memory running out, using ms and mx
_ apparent NullPointerException when things way offscreen
_   i.e. glyphrot with scale set to 4
_   or at least that things get ridiculously slow
_ Compiler.disable() message is weird and doesn't always work
_ exceptions cause play to never un-highlight
_ weird exception crap/messages.. erroneous shite
_ z coordinates are backwards from gl (at least from mazo)
_ look into using serialporteventlistener for simpleserial
_ see about setting up simple bug tracker/feature system
_   would also be nice for people to be able to vote on features
_ look into maxx programming
_ live video editing, wanting things more procedural
_ illustrator exporting
_   version of Illustrator.java that uses bagel api
_ finish color function inside applet
_   do by simplifying stroke/fill/background inside bagel
_     these should be done w/ a switch (STROKE, FILL, BK, OTHER)
_     needs to be done inside cpp version too.. minimize amt of code


MACOS
_ explicity refresh screen on macosx at end of loop:
_   java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().sync();
_ crashes when people click on help in top bar (same in DBN)
_ dataInputStream, setUseCaches on the url to false
_ parent.obj.close() on the url
_ writing serial code (something that docks better to java serial api)


0016
X bug in Bagel.loadImage that made images not work in applets
_ add preferredsize to processingapplet
_ talk to simon about error streams and kjc
_    better piping of output from kjc
_ erroneous errors from kjc regarding 'var not inited'
_   is there any way to disable this message?
_ make size() work for draw() mode
_   inside KjcEngine, reach in and grab calls to 'size'
_   if call is not using a constant number, then punt
_ bezier and catmullrom aren't setting ndim to at least two 
_ translate(x, y) doesn't seem to affect a rect()
_   same with rect. looks like this causing trouble with lots of things
_ it's really a pain to use external files in processing
_   getStream sucks (zach rewrote)
_   should be able to work for application or applets
_   may want to use getResource() (to get things from .jar files)
_ int version of min and abs
_ millis returns 0 (though getMillis() is fine)
_ fix bugs from the 'bugs' file 


0017 (first semi-public release)
_ write code to bind/convert java fonts
_ docs
_   explain using inner classes and using non-public classes
_   start 'errors' section
_     NullPointerException inside setup usually means no size()
_   ability to write functions and inner classes
_   mention ability to use import statements in java mode
_     ability to do real (but not public) classes in same document
_   make note in documentation about getting access to pixel array
_     pixels[] is in ProcessingApplet
_     check to see if get/set functions in applet actually work
_     fix documentation appropriately
_   when images aren't found on disk
_   image formats supported (gif and jpeg)
_   notes about running on win98 and that stupid startup exception
_   make note in documentation about convex polygons
_ post new macintosh version
_   with serial port support
_ setting a fill color when drawing an image should affect the image
_   or maybe image.setColor or setTone to mix a specific color in
_ new user interface?


0018
_ option to enable/disable frame on running applets
_   more like photoshop - presentation mode w/ nothing or frames on all
_ compiling .java files leaves the .class files next to the .java
_   make sure all the dirs in sketchbook added to classpath on startup
_   if new dir added, must restart processing (this is acceptable)
_ ability to include other code from sketchbook directory
_   compile entire sketchbook on startup, then check for new files on compile?
_ when applet window is too large to fit, center and put in back
_ if BagelImage doesn't load, then image() calls arrayindexoutofbounds
_   better solution for this (error while opening image)
_   and document how image loading works
_ keys don't work, even when overriding keyTyped etc.
_ stderr in red color
_ modify kjc to take a PrintWriter, instead of current weird hacks
_ are line and point working in 3D?
_ stop required before kill for applets that use serial
_   this is behaving strangely
_   breaks on every 2nd run when using serial apps (or others?)
_     try calling gc on stop as well


0019
_ run java code besides processing applets 
_   if not processing applet, look for a main(), no main give an error


PROCESSING - NECESSITIES FOR BOOK
_ audio output (play wav, au, aiff(?), mp3)
_ alpha, anti-aliasing


PROCESSING - HIGH
_ bug in paren balancing
_ shift-click on play for 'presentation mode'
_   does full screen and hides editor window
_ export doesn't work properly for stuff included from scrapbook
_ write dist.bat for releases
_   don't forget to update 'export' dir with processing releases
_ what happens if size() not called inside setup() ?
_ when using draw() instead of loop()
_   applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_ multiple types of KjcEngine (so that simplest model is available)
_ write code for automatic macintosh releases
_ make note of functions/variables used by ProcessingApplet
_   using them in your app will break things (i.e. init())


PROCESSING - MEDIUM
_ comprehensive list of reserved keywords
_ better handling on portinuse exception
_   or general exception handling--could go through some interface
_ compile from the sketchbook if there are changes
_ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
_   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
_ curves not properly implemented as part of shape architecture 
_ lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
_ kill button (without stop) doesn't clear play
_ image grabbing code (write to tiff)
_ build a linux/x86 release
_ per-vertex coloring doesn't work
_ the lights prolly shouldn't follow objects around
_ work on courseware applet code signing
_ why is z going negative, seems weird
_   maybe view needs to go from -100 to 100 with zero at screen plane
_ code to save a project to the main machine
_   setting up 'project' directories
_ delayUntil would be nice to have
_   but at some point there has to be a cutoff
_   have a library of useful code that people can add to programs
_   otherwise things are too simple, and env is a crutch
_ courseware menu
_   list of 'people' and 'projects'; refresh 
_   based on local dir named 'projects' or 'sketchbook'?
_ copyPixel(x, y, to_x, to_y)
_ copyArea(x, y, w, h, to_x, to_y)
_ copyImage(image, x, y, w, h,  to_x, to_y)
_ lesson plans (easier to translate)
_ write example applets in processing
_ courseware system 
_   uploading pieces when finished - scrapbook/sketchbook model?
_   download new versions of pde.jar from main machine
_ quicktime exporter or image sequence export
_ how to use ssh identity file to maintain auth for brancusi
_ support for moving the camera around


BAGEL
_ where do the 'error line is 9' messages come from?
_   these are runtime errors inside bagel code, how to trap?
_ get web documentation back into cvs
_ have to get rid of static i/o stuff before porting to c
_   may also need to get rid of floating point constants
_ area copying function: copy(x1, y1, w, h,  xto, yto);
_ should math functions be moved in?
_   this could help porting, and sanity in processingapplet
_   io functions might be treated similarly
_ some method of moving between 
_   center oriented: x, y, radius (3D style)
_   and 2D style: x1, y1, x2, y2
_   or x, y, diameter
_ build in second matrix type: 2d affine
_ add convex polygon type
_ sketch in antialiasing functions
_ how does color depth work on ipaq? 4-4-4? 5-6-5?
_ font usage/substition solution
_   java freetype? jni freetype to build texmap fonts?
_   look at flash file format? (does it have kerning?)
_ simpler bitmap fonts w/o smoothing, just 2D
_ alpha blending (easier)
_ antialiasing


BAGEL - SHOULD
_ bresenham (flat) oval function
_ setting accuracy of circles/sphere
_ setting accuracy of curve segments
_ write shearing function
_ optimize rotation functions
_ test winding polygons in different directions
_ test lighting to see how it compares with gl
_ non-homogenous colors for beginShape()
_   currently disabled b/c homogenousColors not set false for vertices
_   and code not written for curve vertices
_ better lockout inside beginShape() to keep other things from happening
_ when stroke in use, stroke letters (currently stroke doesn't affect


DOCS / ADVANCED
_ adding lights
_   control of position/color of default lights
_ controlling camera movements
_ multmatrix/identity
_ constants besides PI, TWO_PI
_ min/max with 3 parameters
_ if (a) ? 3 : 4
_ formatting printf-style things
_ audio input
_ audio synthesis
_ just saying 'millis' in processingapplet, instead of getMillis()
_ keyPressed, keyReleased, mousePressed, mouseReleased


BUG WATCH 
_ getMillis() returning 0 in some instances/on some machines


PROCESSING - FEATURES
_ run code with a main() that's not a processing applet
_ want emacs-style editor that's faster loading than emacs
_ regexps: http://javaregex.com/cgi-bin/pat/tutorial.asp
_ a better editor: 
_   syntax coloring
_   emacs indents and key commands
_   http://mathsrv.ku-eichstaett.de/MGF/homes/grothmann/je/index.html


PROCESSING - LOWER
_ tweak updater a little bit so it's more likely to work
_   use numbered versioning? 
_   give updater feedback (progress dialog, error msg)
_ move math functions into utility library associated
_   with bagel, because those will be useful on other bagel platforms
_ perlin noise function
_ make some kind of internal color picker
_   could be a separate window that's always around if needed
_ save window x, y, width, height to pde.properties on exit
_ bagelpublic.pl: open ProcessingApplet, rewrite after special token
_ look at glut for other needed shapes
_ make PdeEditorButtons wait until mouseup to change
_   (currently doesn't feel as good as it could)
_ licensing issues with kjc (before public release)


FEEDBACK
_ mcguffin - camera control
_ mcguffin - commands/parameters for code, simple ui for manipulating


ENV
_ env. toggle for showing a function name each time its hit
_ env. toggle for showing line numbers within a function
_   i'm here messages, tie in with breakpoints for debugger
_   lightweight debugger, doesn't slow down, runs in back
_ env. toggle to show attr/value for some var in simple way
_ comments as debugging descriptors, output to console, shown in context
_ comments as naming for shapes drawn after it,
_   or some other model of naming based on inserted text with "" or // or #
_   could fit nicely with printf-style statements and comments
_   comments would contain descriptions //!blah for printing and formatting
_ sketchbook - doodling/scribbling area.. since wacom tablet easily accessible


---------------------------------------------


// ability to write data other than image into the buffer
// pixels won't go away, embrace pixels in sophisticated way
// lists of names of objects, or the 'line number' buffer
// maybe user can introduce new kinds of buffers at will (!!!)

// better 3D for valence/illustrator output:
//   sorting of polygons/lines on simple painters algorithm
//   better lighting model to show darkness at various depths
//     maybe just ultra-high res bitmaps from gl

// drawLine vs moveto, lineto
// less of a deal, until fillpath, since that needs to store the
// last several points. but maybe if it's inside a begin/end
// then it's no big deal, and it's easy to implement

// when casting to an int, should 0.5f be added first

// functions that take 2d arguments are drawn on the
// z = 0 plane, and not affected by current 3D transform matrix


---------------------------------------------

code tidbit:


String binary(int value) {
  return "" + (((value & (1 << 7)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 6)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 5)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 4)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 3)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 2)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 1)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 0)) == 0) ? '0' : '1');
}
