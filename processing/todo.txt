iprocessing todo list // last updated 17 september 2001
(most up-to-date version of this file is in processing cvs)


for 0009
_ ability to include other code from sketchbook directory
_ stop required before kill for applets that use serial
_   this is behaving strangely
_ option to enable/disable frame
_ new objects draw behind old objects with noBackground()
_ enable/disable full screen leaves windows in back
_   (may just require two toFront() calls)
_ breaks on every 2nd run when using serial apps (or others?)
_   try calling gc on stop as well
_ post new macintosh version
_   with serial port support
_ when applet window is too large to fit, center and put in back
_ add a note about editor.expandTabs,balanceParens,tabSize,autoIndent
_   also add note about paren balancing doing strange things
_   leave the others turned on, but parens off by default


PROCESSING - HIGH
_ bug in paren balancing
_ getMillis() doesn't seem to work
_ shift-click on play for 'presentation mode'
_   does full screen and hides editor window
_ export doesn't work properly for stuff included from scrapbook
_ processing applet: fill white, stroke black
_ write dist.bat for releases
_   don't forget to update 'export' dir with processing releases
_ remove duplicates: LINE/LINES etc
_ make tab key work
_   include auto-indent?
_    want emacs-style editor that's faster loading than emacs
_ what happens if size() not called inside setup() ?
_ when using draw() instead of loop()
_   applet needs to notify runner that it has terminated
_ multiple types of KjcEngine (so that simplest model is available)
_ write code for automatic macintosh releases
_ make note of functions/variables used by ProcessingApplet
_   using them in your app will break things (i.e. init())


PROCESSING - MEDIUM
_ better handling on portinuse exception
_   or general exception handling--could go through some interface
_ compile from the sketchbook if there are changes
_ if 'void' left out before loop or setup, cryptic message about
_   'constructor loop must be named Temporary_23498_2343'
_ curves not properly implemented as part of shape architecture 
_ beginShape(POINTS) is not working, no marks are appearing 
_ beginShape(LINE_LOOP) is not looping around 
_ lines become 2 pixels thick after a 3D transform 
_ stroked POLYGON should emulate a LINE_LOOP
_ kill button (without stop) doesn't clear play
_ image grabbing code (write to tiff)
_ build a linux/x86 release
_ per-vertex shading doesn't work
_ the lights prolly shouldn't follow objects around
_ work on courseware applet code signing
_ why is z going negative, seems weird
_   maybe view needs to go from -100 to 100 with zero at screen plane
_ code to save a project to the main machine
_   setting up 'project' directories
_ delayUntil would be nice to have
_   but at some point there has to be a cutoff
_   have a library of useful code that people can add to programs
_   otherwise things are too simple, and env is a crutch
_ courseware menu
_   list of 'people' and 'projects'; refresh 
_   based on local dir named 'projects' or 'sketchbook'?
_ copyPixel(x, y, to_x, to_y)
_ copyArea(x, y, w, h, to_x, to_y)
_ copyImage(image, x, y, w, h,  to_x, to_y)
_ lesson plans (easier to translate)
_ write example applets in processing
_ courseware system 
_   uploading pieces when finished - scrapbook/sketchbook model?
_   download new versions of pde.jar from main machine
_ some kind of text
_ quicktime exporter or image sequence export
_ nice to have a random number generator between -1..1 
_   as well as an integer random; instead of just 0..1
_ show creas how to get access to cvs
_ how to use ssh identity file to maintain auth for brancusi


PROCESSING - FEATURES
_ anti-aliasing
_ alpha
_ regexps: http://javaregex.com/cgi-bin/pat/tutorial.asp
_ a better editor: 
_   syntax coloring
_   emacs indents and key commands
_   http://mathsrv.ku-eichstaett.de/MGF/homes/grothmann/je/index.html


PROCESSING - LOWER
_ tweak updater a little bit so it's more likely to work
_   use numbered versioning? 
_ move math functions into utility library associated
_   with bagel, because those will be useful on other bagel platforms
_ perlin noise function
_ give updater feedback (progress dialog, error msg)
_ get proce55ing.net, make that the target launch site
_ make some kind of internal color picker
_   could be a separate window that's always around if needed
_ write a dbn compatability mode (forever() instead of loop() ?)
_ save window x, y, width, height to pde.properties on exit
_ bagelpublic.pl: open ProcessingApplet, rewrite after special token
_ look at glut for other needed shapes
_ make PdeEditorButtons wait until mouseup to change
_   (currently doesn't feel as good as it could)
_ licensing issues with kjc (before public release)


ENV
_ env. toggle for showing a function name each time its hit
_ env. toggle for showing line numbers within a function
_   i'm here messages, tie in with breakpoints for debugger
_   lightweight debugger, doesn't slow down, runs in back
_ env. toggle to show attr/value for some var in simple way
_ comments as debugging descriptors, output to console, shown in context
_ comments as naming for shapes drawn after it,
_   or some other model of naming based on inserted text with "" or // or #
_   could fit nicely with printf-style statements and comments
_   comments would contain descriptions //!blah for printing and formatting
_ sketchbook - doodling/scribbling area.. since wacom tablet easily accessible


---------------------------------------------

code tidbit:


String binary(int value) {
  return "" + (((value & (1 << 7)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 6)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 5)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 4)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 3)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 2)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 1)) == 0) ? '0' : '1') +
          (((value & (1 << 0)) == 0) ? '0' : '1');
}


---------------------------------------------


0008
X ctrl-s does 'save', button on toolbar does 'save as'
X fixed auto-indent bug for editor
X SimpleSerialDemo.pde had a bug (was old version)


0007
X serial bugs
X   ability to control sleep time from simple
X   message[] not buffer[]
X   synchronize
X   signed byte crap is confusing, make into chars
X bk(n), fill(n), stroke(n) should be consistent with tuples
X make notes in serial docs
X   processing app needs to start first
X   currently a bug requiring stop the close before starting


0006
X get serial i/o code working in processing
X   how to kill serial when applet stopped
X     finalizer prolly not getting called

0005
X running out of memory, presumably b/c applets not being cleared
X   happens inside init() of applet (at new Bagel())
X   figure out why threads aren't actually dying
X   disassociate processing applet with a window on stop?
X   possible to maintain bagel, but kill applet?
X   or copy bagel's image, and kill that too?

0004
X put debugging stuff back into Kjc (i disabled some stuff) 

0001
X convert documentation to html
o setup imrf linux machine?
